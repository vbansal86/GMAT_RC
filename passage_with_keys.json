[{"passage": {"num": "Passage 1 ", "text": "(This passage was written in 1978.)  Recent years have brought minority -owned businesses in the United States unprecedented opportunities as well as new and significant risks. Civil rights acti vists have long argued that one of the principal reasons why Blacks, Hispanics, and other minority groups have difficulty establishing themselves in business is that they lack access to the sizable orders and subcontracts that are generated by large compan ies. Now Congress, in apparent agreement, has required by law that businesses awarded federal contracts of more than $500,000 do their best to find minority subcontractors and record their efforts to do so on forms filed with the government. Indeed, some f ederal and local agencies have gone so far as to set specific percentage goals for apportioning parts of public works contracts to minority enterprises.  Corporate response appears to have been substantial. According to figures collected in 1977, the total of corporate contracts with minority businesses rose from $77 million in 1972 to $1.1 billion in 1977. The projected total of corporate contracts with minority businesses for the early 1980s is estimated to be over 53 billion per year with no letup antici pated in the next decade. Promising as it is for minority businesses, this increased patronage poses dangers for them, too. First, minority firms risk expanding too fast and overextending themselves financially, since most are small concerns and, unlike la rge businesses, they often need to make substantial investments in new plants, staff, equipment, and the like in order to perform work subcontracted to them. If, thereafter, their subcontracts are for some reason reduced, such firms can face potentially cr ippling fixed expenses. The world of corporate purchasing can be frustrating for small entrepreneurs who get requests for elaborate formal estimates and bids. Both consume valuable time and resources, and a small companys efforts must soon result in order s, or both the morale and the financial health of the business will suffer.  A second risk is that White -owned companies may seek to cash in on the increasing apportionments through formation of joint ventures with minority -owned concerns. Of course, in man y instances there are legitimate reasons for joint ventures; clearly, White and minority enterprises can team up  to acquire business that neither could acquire alone. But civil rights groups and minority business owners have co mplained to Congress about minorities being set up as  fronts  with White backing, rather than being accepted as full partners in legitimate  joint ventures.  Third, a minority enterprise that secures the business of one large corporate customer often runs the danger of becoming and remaining dependent. Even in the best of circumstances, fierce competition from larger, more established companies  makes it difficult for small concerns to broaden their customer bases: when such firms have nearly guaranteed orders from a single corporate benefactor, they may truly have to struggle against complacency arising from their current success.  2 , , ", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Maximum freedom means maximum prod uctiveness; our openness is to be the measure of our stability. Fascination with this ideal has made Americans defy the Old World categories of settled possessiveness versus  unsettling deprivation, the cupidity of retention versus  the cupidity of seizu re, a status quo defended or attacked. The United States, it was believed, had no status quo ante . Our only station was the turning of a stationary wheel, spinning faster and faster. We did not base our system on property but opportunity which meant we  based it not on stability but on mobility. The more things changed, that is, the more rapidly the wheel turned, the steadier we would be. The conventional picture of class politics is composed of the Haves, who want a stability to keep what they have, and  the Have -Nots, who want a touch of  instability and change in which to scramble for  the things they have not. But Americans imagined a condition in which speculators, self-makers, runners  are always using the ne w opportunities given by our land. These economic leaders  (front-runners) would thus be mainly agents of change . The nonstarters were considered the ones who wanted stability, a strong referee to give them some position in the race, a regulative hand to ca lm manic speculation; an authority that can call things to a halt, begin things again from compensatorily staggered starting lines.  Reform in America has been sterile because it can imagine no change except through the extension of this metaphor of a r ace, wider inclusion of competitors, a piece of the action, as it were, for the disenfranchised. There is no attempt to call off the race. Since our only stability is change, America seems not to honor the quiet work that achieves social interdependence and stability. There is, in our legends, no heroism of the office clerk , no stable industrial work force of the people who actually make the system work. There is no pride in being an employee (Wilson asked for a return to the time when everyone was an employer). There has been no boasting about our social workers they are  merely signs of the systems failure, of opportunity denied or not taken, of things to be eliminated. We have no pride in our growing interdependence, in the fact that our system can serve others, that we are able to help those in need; empty boasts from the past make us ashamed of our present achievements, make us try to forget or deny them, move away from them.

The traditional view supposes that the upper mantle of the earth behaves as a liquid when it is subjected to small forces for long periods and that differences in temperature under oceans and continents are sufficient to produce convection in the mantle of the earth with rising convection currents under the mid -ocean ridges and sinking currents under the continents. Theoretically, this convection  would carry the continental plates along as though they were on a conveyor belt  and would provide the forces needed to produce the split that occurs along the ridge. This view may be correct: it has the advantage that the currents are driven by temperature differences that themselves depend on the position of the continents. Such a back -coupling, in which the position of the moving plate has an impact on the forces that move it, could produce complicated and varying motions.  On the other hand, the theory is implausible because convection does not normally occur along lines , and it certainly does not occur along lines broken by frequent offsets  or changes in direction, as the ridge is. Also it is difficult to see how the theory applies to the plate between    7  the Mid -Atlantic Ridge and the ridge in the Indian Ocean. This plate is growing on both sides, and since there is no intermediate trench, the two ridges must  be moving apart. It would be odd if the rising convection currents kept exact pace with them. An alternative theory is that the sinking part of the plate, which is denser than the hotter surrounding mantle, pulls the rest of the plate after it. Again it i s difficult to see how this applies to the ridge in the South Atlantic, where neither the African nor the American plate has a sinking part.  Another possibility is that the sinking plate cools the neighboring mantle and produces convection currents that mo ve the plates. This last theory is attractive because it gives some hope of explaining the enclosed seas, such as the Sea of Japan. These seas have a typical oceanic floor, except that the floor is overlaid by several kilometers of sediment. Their floors have probably been sinking for long periods. It seems possible that a sinking current of cooled mantle material on the upper side of the plate might be the cause of such deep basins. The enclosed seas are an important feature of the earths surface, and ser iously require explanation because, in addition to the enclosed seas that are developing at present behind island arcs, there are a number of older ones of possibly similar origin, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Black Sea, and perhaps the North Sea.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

How such large creatures, which weighed in some cases as much as a piloted hang-glider  and had wingspans from 8 to 12 meters, solved the problems of powered flight, and exactly what these creat ures were reptiles or birds are among the questions scientists have puzzled over.  Perhaps the least controversial assertion about the pterosaurs is that they were reptiles.    9  Their skulls, pelvises, and hind feet are reptilian. The anatomy of their wings sug gests that they did not evolve into the class of birds. In pterosaurs a greatly elongated fourth finger of each forelimb supported a wing -like membrane. The other fingers were short and reptilian, with sharp claws. In birds the second finger is the princip al strut of the wing, which consists primarily of feathers. If the pterosaurs walked on all fours, the three short fingers may have been employed for grasping. When a pterosaur walked or remained stationary, the fourth finger, and with it the wing, could o nly turn upward in an extended inverted V -shape along each side of the animals body.  The pterosaurs resembled both birds and bats in their overall structure and proportions. This is not surprising because the design of any flying vertebrate is subject to aerodynamic constraints. Both the pterosaurs and the birds have hollow bones, a feature that represents a savings in weight. In the birds, however, these bones are reinforced more massively by internal struts.  Although scales typically cover reptiles, the pterosaurs probably had hairy coats. T. H. Huxley reasoned that flying vertebrates must have been warm -blooded because flying implies a high rate of metabolism, which in turn implies a high internal temperature. Huxley speculated that a coat of hair would insulate against loss of body heat and might streamline the body to reduce drag in flight. The recent discovery of a pterosaur specimen covered in long, dense, and relatively thick hairlike fossil material was the first clear evidence that his reasoning wa s correct.  Efforts to explain how the pterosaurs became airborne have led to suggestions that they launched themselves by jumping from cliffs, by dropping from trees , or even by rising into light winds from the crests of waves. Each hypothesis has its diff iculties. The first wrongly assumes that the pterosaurs hind feet resembled a bats and could serve as hooks by which the animal could hang in preparation for flight. The second hypothesis seems unlikely because large pterosaurs could not have landed in t rees without damaging their wings. The third calls for high waves to channel updrafts. The wind that made such waves however, might have been too strong for the pterosaurs to control their flight once airborne.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

This is one o f the most critical yet contentious social policy questions. In many ways, our social statistics exaggerate the degree of hardship. Unemployment does not have the same dire consequences today as it did in the 1930s when most of the unemployed were primary  breadwinners, when income and earnings were usually much closer to the margin of subsistence, and when there were no countervailing social programs for those failing in the labor market. Increasing affluence, the rise of families with more than one wage e arner, the growing predominance of secondary earners among the unemployed, and improved social welfare protection have unquestionably mitigated the consequences of joblessness. Earnings and income data also overstate the dimensions of hardship. Among the m illions with hourly earnings at or below the minimum wage level, the overwhelming majority are from multiple -earner, relatively affluent  families. Most of those counted by the poverty statistics are elderly or handicapped or have family responsibilities wh ich keep them out of the labor force, so the poverty statistics are by no means an accurate indicator of labor market pathologies.  Yet there are also many ways our social statistics underestimate the degree of labor-market -related hardship. The unemploymen t counts exclude the millions of fully employed workers whose wages are so low that their families remain in poverty. Low wages and repeated or prolonged unemployment frequently interact to undermine the capacity for self-support. Since the number experien cing joblessness at some time during the year is several times the number unemployed in any month, those who suffer as a result of forced idleness can equal or exceed average annual unemployment, even though only a minority of the jobless in any month real ly suffer. For every person counted in the monthly unemployment tallies, there is another working part -time because of the inability to find full -time work, or else outside the labor force but wanting a job. Finally, income transfers in our country have al ways focused on the elderly, disabled, and dependent, neglecting the needs of the working poor, so that the dramatic expansion of cash and in -kind transfers does not necessarily mean that those failing in the labor market are adequately protected.  As a res ult of such contradictory evidence, it is uncertain whether those suffering seriously as a result of labor market problems number in the hundreds of thousands or the tens of millions, and, hence, whether high levels of joblessness can be tolerated or must be countered by job creation and economic stimulus.

In part, this stress ca n be attributed to the overlords failure to adjust to a rapidly expanding economy, but the stress was also due to factors beyond the overlords control. Concentration of the samurai in castle -towns had acted as a stimulus to trade. Commercial efficiency, in turn, had put temptations in the way of buyers. Since most samurai had been reduced to idleness by years of peace, encouraged to engage in scholarship and martial exercises or to perform administrative tasks that took little time, it is not surprising t hat their tastes and habits grew expensive. Overlords income, despite the increase in rice production among their tenant farmers, failed to keep pace with their expenses. Although shortfalls in overlords income resulted almost as much from laxity among t heir tax collectors (the nearly inevitable outcome of hereditary office -holding) as from their higher standards of living, a misfortune like a fire or flood, bringing an increase in expenses or a drop in revenue, could put a domain in debt to the city rice -brokers who handled its finances.

It was difficult for individual samurai overlords to increase their income because the amount of rice that farmers could be mad e to pay in taxes was not unlimited, and since the income of Japans central government consisted in part of taxes collected by the shogun from his huge domain, the government too was constrained. Therefore, the Tokugawa shoguns began to look to other sour ces for revenue. Cash profits from government -owned mines were already on the decline because the most easily worked deposits of silver and gold had been exhausted, although debasement of the coinage had compensated for the loss. Opening up new farmland wa s a possibility, but most of what was suitable had already been exploited and further reclamation was technically unfeasible. Direct taxation of the samurai themselves would be politically dangerous. This left the shoguns only commerce as a potential sourc e of government income.  Most of the countrys wealth, or so it seemed, was finding its way into the hands of city merchants. It appeared reasonable that they should contribute part of that revenue to ease the shoguns burden of financing the state. A means  of obtaining such revenue was soon found by levying forced loans, known as goyo-kin; although these were not taxes in the strict sense, since they were irregular in timing and arbitrary in amount, they were high in yield. Unfortunately, they pushed up pri ces. Thus, regrettably, the Tokugawa shoguns search for solvency for the government made it increasingly difficult for individual Japanese who lived on    15  fixed stipends to make ends meet.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Yet there is another form of radiation that permeates the universe : neutrinos. With (as its name implies) no electric charge, and negligible mass, the neutrino interacts with other particles so rarely that a neutrino can cross the entire universe, even traversing substantial aggregations of matter, without being absorbed  or even deflected. Neutrinos can thus escape from regions of space where light and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation are blocked by matter. Furthermore, neutrinos carry with them information about the site and circumstances of their production: the refore, the detection of cosmic neutrinos could provide new information about a wide variety of cosmic phenomena and about the history of the universe.  But how can scientists detect a particle that interacts so infrequently with other matter? Twenty -five y ears passed between Paulis hypothesis that the neutrino existed and its actual detection: since then virtually all research with neutrinos has been with neutrinos created artificially in large particle accelerators and studied under neutrino microscopes. But a neutrino telescope, capable of detecting cosmic neutrinos, is difficult to construct. No apparatus can 20 , ,      detect neutrinos unless it is extremely massive, because great mass is synonymous with huge numbers of nucleons (neutrons and protons), and the mor e massive the detector, the greater the probability of one of its nucleons reacting with a neutrino. In addition, the apparatus must be sufficiently shielded from the interfering effects of other particles.  Fortunately, a group of astrophysicists has prop osed a means of detecting cosmic neutrinos by harnessing the mass of the ocean. Named DUMAND, for Deep Underwater Muon  and Neutrino Detector, the project calls for placing an array of light sensors at a depth of five kilometers under the ocean surface. The detecting medium is the seawater itself: when a neutrino interacts with a particle in an atom of seawater , the re sult is a cascade of electrically charged particles and a flash of light that can be detected by the sensors. The five kilometers of seawater above the sensors will shield them from the interfering effects of other high -energy particles raining down throug h the atmosphere.  The strongest motivation for the DUMAND project is that it will exploit an important source of information about the universe. The extension of astronomy from visible light to radio waves to x-rays and gamma rays never failed to lead to t he discovery of unusual objects such as radio galaxies, quasars, and pulsars.

Consequently, nothing seems good or normal that does not accord with the requirements of the free market. A price that is determined by the seller or, for that matter , established by anyone other than the aggregate of consumers seems pernicious. Accordingly, it requires a major act of will to think of price -fixing  (the determination of prices by the seller) as both normal and having a valuable economic funct ion. In fact, price -fixing is normal in all industrialized societies because the industrial system itself provides, as an effortless consequence of its own development, the price -fixing that it requires. Modern industrial planning requires and rewards great size. Hence, a comparatively small number of large firms will be competing for the same group of consumers. That each large firm will act with consideration of its own needs and thus avoid selling its products for more than its competitors charge is comm only recognized by advocates of free -market economic theories. But each large firm will also act with full consideration of the needs that it has in common with the other large firms competing for the same customers. Each large firm will thus avoid signifi cant price -cutting, because price -cutting would be prejudicial to the common interest in a stable demand for products. Most economists do not see price -fixing when it occurs because they expect it to be brought about by a number of explicit agreements amon g large firms; it is not.  Moreover, those economists who argue that allowing the free market to operate without interference is the most efficient method of establishing prices have not considered the economies of non -socialist countries other than the Uni ted states. These economies employ intentional price -fixing, usually in an overt fashion. Formal price -fixing by cartel and informal price-fixing by agreements covering the members of an industry are commonplace. Were there something peculiarly efficient a bout the free market and inefficient about price -fixing, the countries that have avoided the first and used the second would have suffered drastically in their economic development. There is no indication that they have.  Socialist industry also works withi n a framework of controlled prices. In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union began to give firms and industries some of the flexibility in adjusting prices that a more informal evolution has accorded the capitalist system. Economists in the United States have  hailed the change as a return to the free market.

Sn yder, Daly and Bruns have recently proposed that caffeine affect behavior by countering the activity in the human brain of a naturally occurring chemical called adenosine. Adenosine normally depresses neuron firing in many areas of the brain. It apparently does this by i nhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry nerve impulses from one neuron to the next. Like many other agents that affect neuron firing, adenosine must first bind to specific receptors on neuronal membranes. There are at least two classes of these receptors, which have been designated A 1 and A 2. Snyder et al propose that caffeine, which is structurally similar to adenosine, is able to bind to both types of receptors, which prevents adenosine from attaching  there and allows the neurons to fire more readily than they otherwise would.  For many years, caffeines effects have been attributed to its inhibition of the production of phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the chemical called cyclic AMP. A num ber of neurotransmitters exert their effects by first increasing cyclic AMP concentrations in target neurons. Therefore, prolonged periods at the elevated concentrations, as might be brought about by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, could lead to a greater a mount of neuron firing and, consequently, to behavioral stimulation. But Snyder et al point out that the caffeine concentrations needed to inhibit the production of phosphodiesterase in the brain are much higher than those that produce stimulation. Moreove r, other compounds that block phosphodiesterases activity are not stimulants.  To buttress their case that caffeine acts instead by preventing adenosine binding, Snyder et al compared the stimulatory effects of a series of caffeine derivatives with their a bility to dislodge adenosine from its receptors in the brains of mice. In general, they reported, the ability of the compounds to compete at the receptors correlates with their ability to stimulate locomotion in the mouse; i.e., the higher their capacit y to bind at the receptors, the higher their ability to stimulate locomotion. Theophylline, a close structural relative of caffeine and the major stimulant in tea, was one of the most effective compounds in both regards.  There were some apparent exception s to the general correlation observed between adenosine -receptor binding and stimulation. One of these was a compound called 3-isobuty l-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which bound very well but actually depressed mouse locomotion. Snyder et al suggests that this is not a major stumbling block  to their hypothesis. The problem is that the compound has mixed effects in the brain, a not unusual occurrence with psychoactive drugs.

First, it is the poorest of the poor. Only paltry sums are available for excavating and even less is available for publishing the result s and preserving the sites once excavated. Yet archaeologists deal with priceless objects every day. Second, there is the problem of illegal excavation, resulting in museum -quality pieces being sold to the highest bidder.  I would like to make an outrageous  suggestion that would at one stroke  provide funds for archaeology and reduce the amount of illegal digging. I would propose that scientific archeological expeditions and governmental auth orities sell excavated artifacts on the open market. Such sales would provide substantial funds for the excavation and preservation of archaeological sites and the publication of results.

There is not enough money even to catalogue the finds; as a result, they cannot be found again and become as inaccessible as if they had never been discovered. Indeed, with  the help of a computer, sold artifacts could be more accessible than are the pieces stored in bulging museum basements. Prior to sale, each could be photographed and the list of the purchasers could be maintained on the computer . A purchaser could even be  required to agree to return the piece if it should become needed for scientific purposes.     29  It would be unrealistic to suggest that illegal digging would stop if artifacts were sold on the open market.

Federal efforts to aid minority businesses began in the 1960s when the Small Business Administration (SBA) began making federally guaranteed loans and government -sponsor ed management and technical assistance available to minority business enterprises. While this program enabled many minority entrepreneurs to form new businesses, the results were disappointing, since managerial inexperience, unfavorable locations, and capi tal shortages led    31  to high failure rates. Even  years after the program was implemented, minority business receipts were not quite two percent of the national economys total receipts.  Recently federal policymakers have adopted an approach intended to accele rate development of the minority business sector by moving away from directly aiding small minority enterprises and toward supporting larger, growth -oriented minority firms through intermediary companies. In this approach, large corporations participate in  the development of successful and stable minority businesses by making use of government -sponsored venture capital. The capital is used by a participating company to establish a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Company or MESBIC. The MESBIC t hen provides capital and guidance to minority businesses that have potential to become future suppliers or customers of the sponsoring company.  MESBICs are the result of the belief that providing established firms with easier access to relevant management  techniques and more job -specific experience, as well as substantial amounts of capital, gives those firms a greater opportunity to develop sound business foundations than does simply making general management experience and small amounts of capital availa ble. Further, since potential markets for the minority businesses already exist through the sponsoring companies, the minority businesses face considerably less risk in terms of location and market fluctuation. Following early financial and operating probl ems, sponsoring corporations began to capitalize MESBICs far above the legal minimum of $500,000 in order to generate sufficient income and to sustain the quality of management needed. MESBIC s are now emerging as increasingly important financing sources for minority enterprises.  Ironically, MESBIC staffs, which usually consist of Hispanic and Black professionals, tend to approach investments in minority firms more pragmatically than do many MESBIC directors, who are usually senior managers from sponsoring  corporations. The latter often still think mainly in terms of the social responsibility approach and thus seem to prefer deals that are riskier and less attractive than normal investment criteria would warrant. Such differences in viewpoint have produce d uneasiness among many minority staff members, who feel that minority entrepreneurs and businesses should be judged by established business considerations. These staff members believe their point of view is closer to the original philosophy of MESBICs an d they are concerned that, unless a more prudent course is followed, MESBIC directors may revert to  policies likely to re -create the disappointing results of the original SBA approach.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Rather, in their day-by-day tactical maneuvers, these senior executives rely on what is vaguely termed intuition to manage a network of interrelated problems that require them to deal with ambiguity, inconsistency, novelty, and surprise; and to integrate action into the process o f thinking.  Generations of writers on management have recognized that some practicing managers rely heavily on intuition. In general, however, such writers display a poor grasp of what intuition is. Some see it as the opposite of rationality ; others view it as an excuse for capriciousness.  Isenbergs recent research on the c ognitive processes of senior managers reveals that managers intuition is neither of these. Rather, senior managers use intuition in at least five distinct ways. First, they intuitively sense when a problem exists. Second, managers rely on intuition to per form well -learned behavior patterns rapidly. This intuition is not arbitrary or irrational, but is based on years of painstaking practice and hands -on experience that build skills. A third function of intuition is to synthesize isolated bits of data and pr actice into an integrated picture, often in an Aha! experience. Fourth, some managers use intuition as a check on the results of more rational analysis. Most senior executives are familiar with the formal decision analysis models and tools, and those who  use such systematic methods for reaching decisions are occasionally leery of solutions suggested by these methods which run counter to  their sense of the correct course of action. Finally, managers can use intuition to bypass in -depth analysis and move rapidly to engender a plausible solution. Used in this way, intuition is an almost instantaneous cognitive process in which a ma nager recognizes familiar patterns. One of the implications of the intuitive style of executive management is that thinking is inseparable from acting. Since managers often know what is right before they can analyze and explain it, they frequently act first and explain later. Analysis is inextricably tied to action in thinking/acting cycles, in which managers develop thoughts about their companies and organizations not by analyzing a problematic situation and then acting, but by acting and analyzing in close concert.  Given the great uncertainty of many of the management issues that they face, senior managers often instigate a course of action simply to learn more about an issue. They then use the results of the action to develop a more complete understan ding of the issue. One implication of thinking/acting cycles is that action is often part of defining the problem, not just    35  of implementing the solution.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

This led them to believe that the cells in the early embryo are undetermined in the sense that each cell has the potential to develop in a variety of different ways. Later biologists found that the situation was not so simple. It matters in which plane the embryo is cut. If it is cut in a plane different from the one used by the early investigators, it will not form two whole embryos.  A debate arose over what exactly was happening. Which embryo cells are determined, just when do they  becom e irreversibly committed to their fates, and what are the morphogenetic determinants that tell a cell what to become? But the debate could not be resolved because no one was able to ask the crucial questions in a form in which they could be pursued produ ctively. Recent discoveries in molecular biology, however, have opened up prospects for a resolution of the debate. Now investigators think they know at least some of the molecules that act as morphogenetic determinants in early development. They have been  able to show that, in a sense, cell determination begins even before an egg is fertilized.  Studying sea urchins , biolog ist Paul Gross found that an unfertilized egg contains substances that function as morphogenetic determinants. They are located in the cytoplasm of the egg cell; i.e., in that part of the cells protoplasm that lies outside of the nucleus. In the unfertili zed egg, the substances are inactive and are not distributed homogeneously. When the egg is fertilized, the substances become active and, presumably, govern the behavior of the genes they interact with. Since the substances are unevenly distributed in the egg, when the fertilized egg divides, the resulting cells are different from the start and so can be qualitatively different in their own gene activity.  The substances that Gross studied are maternal messenger RNAs products of certain of the maternal gene s. He and other biologists studying a wide variety of organisms have found that these particular RNAs direct, in large part, the synthesis of histones, a class of proteins that bind to DNA. Once synthesized, the histones move into the cell nucleus, where section of DNA wrap around them to form a structure that resembles beads, or knots, on a string. The beads are DNA segments wrapped around the histones; the string is the intervening DNA. And it is the structure of these beaded DNA strings that guide the f ate of the cells in which they are located.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

It has been frequently assumed, but not proved, that the majority of the migrants in what has come to be called the Great Migration came from rural areas and were motivated by two concurrent factors: the collapse of the cotton industry following the boll weevil  infestation, which began in 1898, and increased demand in the North for labor following the cessation of European immigration caused by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.  This assumption has led to the conclusion that the migrants subsequ ent lack of economic mobility in the North is tied to rural background, a background that implies unfamiliarity with urban living and a lack of industrial skills.  But the question of who actually left the South has never been rigorously investigated. Although numerous investigations document an exodus from rural southern areas to southern cities prior to the Great Migration , no one has considered whether the same migrants then moved on to northern cities. In 1910 over 600,0 00 Black workers, or ten percent o f the Black work force, reported themselves to be engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits, the federal census category roughly encompassing the entire industrial sector. The Great Migration could easily have been made up entirely of this group a nd their families. It is perhaps surprising to argue that an employed population could be enticed to move, but an explanation lies in the labor conditions then prevalent in the South.  About thirty -five percent of the urban Black population in the South was  engaged in skilled trades. Some were from the old artisan class of slavery blacksmiths , masons, carpenters which  had had a monopoly of certain trades, but they were gradually being pushed out by competition, mechanization, and obsolescence . The remaining sixty-five percent, more recently urbanized, worked in newly developed industries tobacco , lumber, coal and iron manufacture, and railroads. Wages in the South, however, were low, and Black workers were aware, through labor recruiters and the Black press, that they could earn more even as unskilled workers in the North than they could as artisans in the South. After the boll weevil infestation, urban Black workers faced competition from the continuing influx of both Black and White rural workers, who were d riven to undercut the wages formerly paid for industrial jobs.

In contrast, less than a century later, in 1979, the parents of a three-year-old sued in New York for accidental -death damages and won an award of $750,000.  The transformation in social values implicit in juxtaposing these two incidents is the subject    43  of Viviana Zelizers excellent book, Pricing the Priceless Child . During the nineteenth century, she argues, the concept of the useful ch ild who contributed to the family economy gave way gradually to the present -day notion of the useless child who, though producing no income for, and indeed extremely costly to, its parents, is yet considered emotionally priceless. Well established amon g segments of the middle and upper classes by the mid -1800s, this new view of childhood spread throughout society in the late-nineteenth and early -twentieth centuries as reformers introduced child -labor regulations and compulsory education  laws predicated in part on the assumption that a childs emotional value made child labor taboo.  For Zelizer the origins of this transformation were many and complex. The gradual erosion of childrens productive value in a maturing industri al economy, the decline in birth and death rates, especially in child mortality, and the development of the companionate family (a family in which members were united by explicit bonds of love rather than duty) were all factors critical in changing the ass essment of childrens worth. Yet expulsion of children from the  cash nexus , although clearly shaped by profound changes in the economic, occupational, and family structures, Zelizer maintains, was also part of a cultural process of sacrelization of childrens lives. Protecting children from the crass busines s world became enormously important for late-nineteenth -century middle -class Americans, she suggests; this sacralization was a way of resisting what they perceived as the relentless corruption of human values by the marketplace.  In stressing the cultural d eterminants of a childs worth , Zelizer takes issue with practitioners of the new sociological economics, who have analyzed such traditionally sociological topics as crime, marriage, education, and health solely in terms of their economic determinants. A llowing only a small role for cultural forces in the form of individual preferences, these sociologists tend to view all human behaviors as directed primarily by the principle of maximizing economic gain. Zelizer is highly critical of this approach, and emphasizes instead the opposite phenomenon: the power of social values to transform price. As children became more valuable in emotional terms, she argues, their exchange or surrender value on the market, that is, the conversion of their intangible wor th into cash terms, became much greater.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

The factors favoring unionization drives seem to have been either the presence of large numbers of workers, as in New York Cit y, to make it worth the effort, or the concentration of small numbers in one or two locations, such as a hospital, to make it relatively easy . Receptivity to unionization on the workers part was also a consideration, but when there were large numbers invo lved or the clerical workers were the only unorganized group in a jurisdiction, the multi -occupational unions would often try to organize them regardless of the workers initial receptivity. The strategic reasoning was based, first, on the concern that pol iticians and administrators might play off  unionized against non -unionized workers, and, second, on the conviction that a fully unionized public work force meant power, both at the bargaining table and in the legislature. In localities where clerical workers were few in number, were scattered in several workplaces, and expressed no interest in being organized, unions more often than not ignored them in the pre -1975 period.  But since the mid -1970s, a different strategy has emerged. In 1977, 34 percent of government clerical workers we re represented by a labor organization, compared with 46 percent of government professionals, 44 percent of government blue -collar workers, and 41 percent of government service workers . Since then, however, the biggest increases in public -sector unionizati on have been among clerical workers. Between 19 77 and 1980, the number of unionized government workers in blue -collar and service occupations increased only about  1.5 percent, while in the white -collar occupations the increase was 20 percent and among cler ical workers in particular, the increase was 22 percent.  What accounts for this upsurge in unionization among clerical workers? First, more women have entered the work force in the past few years, and more of them plan to remain working until retirement ag e. Consequently, they are probably more concerned than their predecessors were about job security and economic benefits. Also, the womens movement has succeeded in 46 , ,      legitimizing the economic and political activism of women on their own behalf, thereby producing a more positive attitude toward unions. The absence of any comparable increase in unionization among private -sector clerical workers, however, identifies the primary catalyst the structural change in the multi -occupational public -sector unions themse lves. Over the past twenty years, the occupational distribution in these unions has been steadily shifting from predominantly blue -collar to predominantly white -collar. Because there are far more women in white -collar jobs, an increase in the proportion of  female members has accompanied the occupational shift and has altered union policy -making in favor of organizing women and addressing womens issues.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

For sometime this theory was considered untestable, largel y because there was no sufficiently precise chronology of the ice ages with which the orbital variations could be matched.  To establish such a chronology it is necessary to determine the relative amounts of land ice that existed at various times in the Ear ths past. A recent discovery makes such a determination possible: relative land -ice volume for a given period can be deduced from the ratio of two oxygen isotopes, 16 and 18, found in ocean sediments. Almost all the oxygen in water is oxygen 16, but a few  molecules out of every thousand incorporate the heavier isotope 18. When an ice age begins, the continental ice sheets grow, steadily reducing the amount of water evaporated from the ocean that will eventually return to it. Because heavier isotopes tend t o be left behi nd when water evaporates from the ocean surfaces, the remaining ocean water becomes progressively enriched in oxygen 18. The degree of enrichment can be determined by analyzing ocean sediments of the period, because these sediments are compos ed of calcium carbonate  shells of marine organisms, shells that were constructed with oxygen atoms drawn from the surrounding ocean. The higher the ratio of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 in a sedimentary specimen, the more land ice t here was when the sediment was laid down.  As an indicator of shifts in the Earths climate, the isotope record has two advantages. First, it is a global record: there is remarkably little variation in isotope ratios in sedimentary specimens taken from diff erent continental locations. Second, it is a more continuous record than that taken from rocks on land. Because of these advantages, sedimentary evidence can be dated with sufficient accuracy by radiometric methods to establish a precise chronology of the ice ages. The dated isotope record shows that the fluctuations in global ice volume over the past several hundred thousand years have a pattern: an ice age occurs roughly once every 100,000 years. These data have established a strong connection between var iations in the Earths orbit and the periodicity of the ice ages.     49  However, it is important to note that other factors, such as volcanic particulates or variations in the amount of sunlight received by the Earth, could potentially have affected the climate.  The advantage of the Milankovitch theory is that it is testable: changes in the Earths orbit can be calculated and dated by applying Newtons laws of gravity to progressively earlier configurations of the bodies in the solar system.

Specifically, this analysis indicates that support networks play a critical role in starting and maintaining minority busine ss enterprises by providing owners with a range of assistance, from the informal encouragement of family members and friends to dependable sources of labor and clientele from the owners ethnic group . Such self -help networks, which encourage and support ethnic minority entrepreneurs, consist of primary institutions, those closest to the individual in shaping his or her behavior and beliefs. They are characterized by the face -to-face associa tion and cooperation of persons united by ties of mutual concern. They form an intermediate social level between the individual and larger secondary  institutions based on impersonal relationships. Primary institutions comprising the support network inclu de kinship, peer, and neighborhood or community subgroups.  A major function of self -help networks is financial support. Most scholars agree that minority business owners have depended primarily on family funds and ethnic community resources for investment capital. Personal savings have been accumulated, often through frugal living habits that require sacrifices by the entire family and are thus a product of long -term family financial behavior. Additional loans and gifts from relatives, forthcoming because o f group obligation rather than narrow investment calculation, have supplemented personal savings. Individual entrepreneurs do not necessarily rely on their kin because they cannot obtain financial backing from commercial resources. They may actually avoid banks because they assume that commercial institutions either cannot comprehend the special needs of minority enterprise or charge unreasonably high interest rates.  Within the larger ethnic community, rotating credit associations have been used to raise capital. These associations are informal clubs of friends and other trusted members of the ethnic group who make regular contributions to a fund that is given to each contributor in rotation. One author estimates that 40 percent of New York Chinatown firms e stablished during 1900-1950 utilized such associations as their initial source of capital. However, recent immigrants and third or fourth generations of older groups now employ rotating credit 52 , ,      associations only occasionally to raise investment funds. Some groups, like Black Americans, found other means of financial support for their entrepreneurial efforts. The first Black -operated banks were created in the late nineteenth century as depositories  for dues collected from fraternal or lodge groups, which themselves had sprung from Black churches. Black banks made limited investments in other Black enterprises. Irish immigrants in American cities organized many building and loan associations to provide capital for home construction and purchase.

Thus, flowering plant species dependent on insect pollination, as opposed to self-pollination or wind pollination, could be endangered when the population of insect -pollinators is depleted by  the use of pesticides.  In the forests of New Brunswick, for example, various pesticides have been sprayed in the past 25 years in efforts to control the spruce budworm, an economically significant pest. Scientists have now investigated the effects of the spraying of Matacil, one of the anti -budworm agents that is least toxic to insect -pollinators. They studied Matacils effects on insect mortality in a wide variety of wild insect species and on plant fecundity, expressed as the percentage of the total flow ers on an individual plant that actually developed fruit and bore seeds. They found that the most pronounced mortality after the spraying of Matacil occurred among the smaller bees and one family of flies, insects that were all important pollinators of num erous species of plants growing beneath the tree canopy of forests. The fecundity of plants in one common indigenous species, the red -osier dogwood, was significantly reduced in the sprayed areas as compared to that of plants in control plots where Matacil  was not sprayed. This species is highly dependent on the insect -pollinators most vulnerable to Matacil. The creeping dogwood, a species similar to the red -osier dogwood, but which is pollinated by large bees, such as bumblebees, showed no significant decl ine in fecundity. Since large bees are not affected by the spraying of Matacil, these results a dd weight to the argument that spraying where the pollinators are sensitive to the pesticide used decreases plant fecundity.  The question of whether the decrease  in plant fecundity caused by the spraying of pesticides actually causes a decline in the overall population of flowering plant species still remains unanswered. Plant species dependent solely on seeds for survival or dispersal are obviously more vulnerabl e to any decrease in plant fecundity that occurs, whatever its cause. If, on the other hand, vegetative growth and dispersal (by means of shoots or runners) are available as alternative reproductive strategies for a species, then decreases in plant fecundi ty may be of little consequence. The fecundity effects described here are likely to have the most profound impact on plant species with all four of the following characteristics: a short life span, a narrow geographic range, an incapacity for vegetative pr opagation, and a dependence on a small number of insect -pollinator species.

Although at first the colonies held little positive attraction for the English they would rather have stayed home by the eighteenth century people increasingly migrated to America because they regarded it as the land of opportunity. Secondly, Bailyn holds that, contrary to the notion that used to flourish in America history textbooks, the re was never a typical New World community. For example, the economic and demographic character of early New England towns varied considerably.  Bailyns third proposition suggests two general patterns prevailing among the many thousands of migrants: one gr oup came as indentured servants, another came to acquire land. Surprisingly, Bailyn suggests that those who recruited indentured servants were the driving forces of transatlantic migration. These colonial entrepreneurs helped determine the social character  of people who came to preindustrial North America. At first, thousands of unskilled laborers were recruited; by the 1730s, however, American employers demanded skilled artisans.  Finally, Bailyn argues that the colonies were a half -civilized hinterland of  the European culture system. He is undoubtedly correct to insist that the colonies were part of an Anglo -American empire. But to divide the empire into English core and colonial periphery, as Bailyn does, devalues the achievements of colonial culture. It is true, as Bailyn claims, that high culture in the colonies never matched that in England. But what of  seventeenth -century New England, where the settlers created eff ective laws, built a distinguished university, and published books? Bailyn might respond that New England was exceptional. However, the ideas and institutions developed by New England Puritans had powerful effects on North American culture.  Although Bailyn  goes on to apply his approach to some thousands of indentured servants who migrated just prior to the revolution, he fails to link their experience with the political development of the United States. Evidence presented in his work suggests how we might make such a connection. These indentured servants were treated as slaves for the period during which they had sold their time to American employers. It is not surprising that as soon as they served their time they passed up  good wages in th e cities and headed west to ensure their personal independence by acquiring land. Thus, it is in the west that a peculiarly American political culture began, among colonists who were suspicious of authority and intensely anti-aristocratic.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Another 340 charge th at foreign companies 60 , ,      dumped their products in the United States at less than fair value. Even when no unfair practices are alleged, the simple claim that an industry has been injured by imports is sufficient grounds to seek relief.  Contrary to the gene ral impression, this quest for import relief has hurt more companies than it has helped. As corporations begin to function globally, they develop an intricate web of marketing, production, and research relationships . The complexity of these relationships m akes it unlikely that a system of import relief laws will meet the strategic needs of all the units under the same parent company.  Internationalization increases the danger that foreign companies will use import relief laws against the very companies the l aws were designed to protect. Suppose a United States -owned company establishes an overseas plant to manufacture a product while its competitor makes the same product in the United States. If the competitor can prove injury from the imports and that the Un ited States company received a subsidy from a foreign government to build its plant abroad the United States companys products will be uncompetitive in the United States, since they would be subject to duties.  Perhaps the most brazen  case occurred when the ITC investigated allegations that Canadian companies were injuring the United States salt industry by dumping rock salt , used to de-ice roads. The bizarre aspect of the complaint was that a foreign c onglomerate with United States operations was crying for  help against a United States company with foreign operations.

Ethnologists had a distinct reason for wanting to hear the stories: they were after linguistic or anthropological data that would supplement their own field observations, and they believe d that the personal stories, even of a single individual, could increase their understanding of the cultures that they had been observing from without . In addition many ethnologists at the turn of the century believed that Native American manners and customs were rapidly disappearing, and that it was important to preserve for posterity as much information as could be adequately recorded before th e cultures disappeared forever.  There were, however, arguments against this method as a way of acquiring accurate and complete information. Franz Boas, for example, described autobiographies as being of limited value, and useful chiefly for the study of t he perversion of truth by memory, while Paul Radin contended that investigators rarely spent enough time with the tribes they were observing, and inevitably derived results too tinged by the investigators own emotional tone to be reliable.  Even more impo rtantly, as these life stories moved from the traditional oral mode to recorded written form, much was inevitably lost. Editors often decided what elements were    63  significant to the field research  on a given tribe. Native Ameri cans recognized that the essence of their lives could not be communicated in English and that events that they thought significant were often deemed unimportant by their interviewers. Indeed, the very act of telling their stories could force Native America n narrators to distort their cultures, as taboos had to be broken to speak the names of dead relatives crucial to their family stories.  Despite all of this, autobiography remains a useful tool for ethnological research: such personal reminiscences and impr essions, incomplete as they may be, are likely to throw more light on the working of the mind and emotions than any amount of speculation from an ethnologist or ethnological theorist from another culture.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

How then can these cel ls differentiate and form structures as different as roots, stems, leaves, and fruits? The answer is that only a small subset of the genes in a particular kind of cell are expressed, or turned on, at a given time. This is accomplished by a complex system o f chemical messengers that in plants include hormones and other regulatory molecules. Five major hormones have been identified: auxin, abscisic acid , cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellin. Studies of plants have now identified a new class of regulatory molecules called oligosaccharins.  Unlike the oligosaccharins, the five well -known plant hormones are pleiotropic rather than specific; that is, e ach has more than one effect on the growth and development of plants. The five has so many simultaneous effects that they are not very useful in artificially controlling the growth of crops. Auxin, for instance, stimulates the rate of cell elongation, caus es shoots to grow up and roots to grow down, and inhibits the growth of lateral shoots. Auxin also causes the plant to develop a vascular system, to form lateral roots, and to produce ethylene.  The pleiotropy of the five well -studied plant hormones is some what analogous to that of certain hormones in animal. For example, hormones from the hypothalamus in the brain stimulate the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland  to synthesize and release many different hormones, one of which s timulates the release of hormones from the adrenal cortex . These hormones have specific effects on target organs all over the body. One hormone stimulates the thyroid gland, for example, another the ovarian follicle  cells, and so forth. In other words, there is a hierarchy of hormones. Such a hierarchy may also exist in plants. Oligosaccharins are fragments of the cell wall released by enzymes: different enzymes release different oligosaccharins. There are indi cations that pleiotropic plant hormones may actually function by activating the enzymes that release these other, more specific chemical messengers from the cell wall.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Few academic programs have eve r received such public attention. In broadcast debates, critics dismissed the program as a betrayal of national identity, an imitation of Western ideas, and a distraction from the real task of national unification and economic development. Even supporters underestimated the program; they thought it would be merely another of the many Western ideas that had already proved useful in Asian culture, akin to airlines, electricity, and the assembly line. The founders of the program, however, realized that neither  view was correct. They had some reservations about the applicability of Western feminist theories to the role of women in Asia and felt that such theories should be closely examined. Their approach has thus far  yielded important critiques o f Western theory, informed by the special experience of Asian women.  For instance, like the Western feminist critique of the Freudian model of the human psyche, the Korean critique finds Freudian theory culture -bound, but in ways different from those cited  by Western theorists. The Korean theorists claim that Freudian theory assumes the universality of the Western nuclear, male -headed family and focuses on the personality formation of the individual, independent of  society . An analysis based on such assumptions could be valid for a highly competitive, individualistic society. In the Freudian family drama , family members are assumed to be engaged in a Darwinian struggle against each other father against son and sibling against sibling. Such a concept projects the competitive model of Western society onto human personalities. But in the Asian concept of personal ity there is no ideal attached to individualism or to the independent self. The Western model of personality development does not explain major characteristics of the Korean personality, which is social and group -centered. The self is a social being defi ned by and acting in a group, and the well -being of both men and women is determined by the equilibrium of the group, not by individual self-assertion . The ideal is one of interdependency.  In such a context, what is recognized as dependency in Western psychiatric terms is not, in Korean terms, an admission of weakness or failure. All this bears directly on the Asian perception o f mens and womens psychology because men are also dependent . In Korean culture, men cry and otherwise easily show their emotions, something that might be considered a betrayal of masculinity in Western culture. In the kinship -based society of Korea, fo ur generations may live in the same house, which means that people can be sons and daughters all their lives, whereas in Western culture, the roles of husband and son, wife and daughter, are often incompatible.  68 , , ", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

First, the material rocks, lakes, vegetation, etc.on which the method relies must be widespread enough to provide plenty of information, since analysis of material that is rarely encountered will not permit co rrelation with other regions or with other periods of geological history. Second, in the process of formation, the material must have received an environmental signal that reflects a change in climate and that can be deciphered by modern physical or chemic al means. Third, at least some of the material must have retained the signal unaffected by subsequent changes in the environment. Fourth, it must be possible to determine the time at which the inferred climatic conditions held. This last criterion is more easily met in dating marine sediments, because dating of only a small number of layers in a marine sequence allows the age of other layers to be estimated fairly reliably by extrapolation and interpolation. By contrast, because sedimentation is much less c ontinuous in continental regions, estimating the age of a continental bed from the known ages of beds above and below is more risky.  One very old method used in the investigation of past climatic conditions involves the measurement of water levels in ancie nt lakes. In temperate regions, there are enough lakes for correlations between them to give us a reliable picture. In arid and semiarid regions, on the other hand, the small number of lakes and the great distances between them reduce the possibilities for  correlation. Moreover, since lake levels are controlled by rates of evaporation as well as by precipitation, the interpretation of such levels is ambiguous. For instance, the fact that lake levels in the semiarid southwestern United States appear to have been higher during the last ice age than they are now was at one time attributed to increased precipitation. On the basis of snow -line elevations, however, it has been concluded that the climate then was not necessarily wetter than it is now, but rather th at both summers and winters were cooler, resulting in reduced evaporation.  Another problematic method is to reconstruct former climates on the basis of pollen profiles. The type of vegetation in a specific region is determined by identifying and counting the various pollen grains found there. Although the relationship between vegetation and climate is not as direct as the relationship between climate and lake levels, the method often works well in the temperate zones.

(Cost -cutting here is defined as raising labor  output while holding the amount of labor constant.) However, from 1978 through 1982, productivity the value of goods manufactured divided by the amount of labor input did not improve; and while the results were better in the business upturn of the three y ears following, they ran 25 percent lower than productivity improvements during earlier, post-1945 upturns. At the same time, it became clear that the harder manufactures worked to implement cost -cutting, the more they lost their competitive edge.  With thi s paradox in mind, I recently visited 25 companies; it became clear to me that the cost-cutting approach to increasing productivity is fundamentally flawed. Manufacturing regularly observes a 40, 40, 20 rule. Roughly 40 percent of any manufacturing -based  competitive advantage derives from long -term changes in manufacturing structure  (decisions about the number, size, location, and capacity of facilities) and in approaches to materials. Another 40 percent comes from major changes in equipment and process t echnology. The final 20 percent rests on implementing conventional cost -cutting. This rule does not imply that cost-cutting should not be tried. The well -known tools of this approach including simplifying jobs and retraining employees to work smarter, not harder do produce results. But the tools quickly reach the limits of what they can contribute.  Another problem is that the cost -cutting approach hinders innovation and discourages creative people. As Abernathys study of automobile manufacturers has shown,  an industry can easily become prisoner of its own investments in cost -cutting techniques, reducing its ability to develop new products. And managers under pressure to maximize cost -cutting will resist innovation because they know that more fundamental cha nges in processes or systems will wreak  havoc with the results on which they are measured. Production managers have always seen their job as one of minimizing costs and maximizing output. This dimension of performance has  until recently sufficed as a basis of evaluation, but it has created a penny -pinching , mechanistic culture in most factories that has kept away creative managers.  Every company I know that has freed itself from the paradox has done so, in part, by developing and implementing a manufacturing strategy. Such a strategy focuses on the manufacturing structure and on equipment and process technology. In one company a manufacturing strategy that allowed different areas of the factory to spe cialize in different markets replaced the conventional cost -cutting approach; within three years the company regained its competitive advantage. Together with such strategies, successful companies are 74 , ,      also encouraging managers to focus on a wider set of ob jectives besides cutting costs. There is hope for manufacturing, but it clearly rests on a different way of managing.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

From the perspective of womens history, Turners exclusively masculine assumptions constitute a major drawback: his defenders and critics alike have reconstructed mens, not womens, liv es on the frontier. However, precisely because of this masculine orientation, revising the Frontier Thesis  by focusing on womens experience introduces new themes into womens history woman as lawmaker and entrepreneur and, consequently, new interpretation s of womens relationship to capital, labor, and statute.  Turner claimed that the frontier produced the individualism that is the hallmark of American culture, and that this individualism in turn promoted democratic institutions and economic equality. He a rgued for the frontier as an agent of social change. Most novelists and historians writing in the early to midtwentieth century who considered women in the West, when they considered women at all, fell under Turners spell . In their works these authors tended to glorify womens contributions to frontier life. Western women, in Turnerian tradition, were a fiercely independent, capable, and durable lot, free from  the constraints binding their eastern sisters. This interpretation implied that the West provided a congenial environment where women could aspire to their own goals, free from constrictive stereotypes and sexist  attitudes. In T urnerian terminology, the frontier had furnished a gate of escape from the bondage of the past.  By the middle of the twentieth century, the Frontier Thesis  fell into  disfavor among historians. Later, Reactionist writers took  the view that frontier women were lonely, displaced persons in a hostile milieu that intensified the worst aspects of gender relations. The renaissance of the feminist movement during the 1970s led to the Stasist school, which sidestepped the good bad di chotomy and argued that frontier women lived lives similar to the live of women in the East.

Recent field studies, however, suggest that during more typical dives in the wild, this seals physiological behavior is different.  In the laboratory, when the seal dives below the surface of the water and stops breathing, its heart beats more slowly, requiring less oxygen, and its arteries become constricted, ensuring that the seals blood remains concentrated near those  organs most crucial to its ability to navigate underwater. The seal essentially shuts off the flow of blood to other organs, which either stop functioning until the seal surfaces or switch to an anaerobic (oxygen -independent) metabolism. The latter result s in the production of large amounts of lactic acid  which can adversely affect the pH of the seals blood , but since the anaerobic metabolism occurs only in those tissues which have been isolated from the seals blood supply, the lactic acid is released into the seals blood only after the seal surfaces , when the lungs, liver, and other organs quickly clear the acid from the seals bloodstream.  Recent field studies, however, reveal that on dives in the wild, the seal usually heads directly for its prey and returns to the surface in less than twenty minut es. The absence of high levels of lactic acid in the seals blood after such dives suggests that during them, the seals organs do not resort to the anaerobic metabolism observed in the laboratory, but are supplied with oxygen from the blood. The seals lo nger excursions underwater, during which it appears to be either exploring distant routes or evading a predator, do evoke the diving response seen in the laboratory.

Yet while we now have studies of working -class communities and culture, we know remarkably little of worklessness. When historians have paid any attention at all to unemployment, they have focused on the Great Depression of the 1930s. The narrowness of this perspective ignores the pervasive recess ions and joblessness of the previous decades, as Alexander Keyssar shows in his recent book. Examining the period 1870 -1920, Keyssar    81  concentrates on Massachusetts, where the historical materials are particularly rich, and the findings applicable to other i ndustrial areas.  The unemployment rates that Keyssar calculates appear to be relatively modest, at least by Great Depression standards: during the worst years, in the 1870s and 1890s, unemployment was around 15 percent. Yet Keyssar rightly understands th at a better way to measure the impact of unemployment is to calculate unemployment frequencies measuring the percentage of workers who experience any unemployment in the course of  a year. Given this perspective, joblessness looms much larger.  Keyssar also scrutinizes unemployment patterns according to skill level, ethnicity, race, age, class, and gender. He finds that rates of joblessness differed primarily according to clas s: those in middle -class and white -collar occupations were far less likely to be unemployed. Yet the impact of unemployment on a specific class was not always the same. Even when dependent on the same trade, adjoining communities could have dramatically di fferent unemployment rates. Keyssar uses these differential rates to help explain a phenomenon that has puzzled historians the startlingly high rate of geographical mobility in the nineteenth -century United States. But mobility was not the dominant working -class strategy for coping with unemployment, nor was assistance from private charities or state agencies. Self -help and the help of kin got most workers through jobless spells.

Although pressure to recruit women directors, unlike that to employ women in the general work force, does no t derive from legislation, it is nevertheless real.  Although small companies were the first to have women directors, large corporations currently have a higher percentage of women on their boards. When the chairs of these large corporations began recruitin g women to serve on boards, they initially sought women who were chief executive officers (CEOs) of large corporations. However, such women CEOs are still rare. In addition, the ideal of six CEOs (female or male) serving on the board of each of the larg est corporations is realizable only if every CEO serves on six boards. This raises the specter of director over -commitment and the resultant dilution of contribution. Consequently, the chairs next sought women in business who had the equivalent of CEO expe rience. However, since it is only recently that large numbers of women have begun to rise in management, the chairs began to recruit women of high achievement outside the business world. Many such women are well known for their contributions in government,  education, and the nonprofit sector. The fact that the women from these sectors who were appointed were often acquaintances of the boards chairs seems quite reasonable: chairs have always considered it important for directors to interact  comfortably in the boardroom.  84 , ,      Although many successful women from outside the business world are unknown to corporate leaders, these women are particularly qualified to serve on boards because of the changing nature of corporations. Today a compa nys ability to be responsive to the concerns of the community and the environment can influence that companys growth and survival. Women are uniquely positioned to be responsive to some of these concerns. Although conditions have changed, it should be re membered that most directors of both sexes are over fifty years old.

There is no doubt that chronic disease was an important factor in the precipitous decline, and it is highly probable that the greatest killer was epidemic disease , especially as manifested in virgin -soil epidemics.  Virgin -soil epidemics are those in which the populations at risk have had no previous contact with the diseases that strike them and are therefore immunologically almost defenseless. That virgi n-soil epidemics were important in American history is strongly indicated by evidence that a number of dangerous maladies smallpox, measles, malaria, yellow fever, and undoubtedly several more were unknown in the pre -Columbian New World. The effects of their sudden introduction are demonstrated in the early chronicles of America, which contain reports of horrendous epidemics and steep population declines, confirmed in many cases by recent quantitative analyses of Spanish tribute records and other sources. T he evidence provided by the documents of British and French colonies is not as definitive because the conquerors of those areas did not establish permanent settlements and begin to keep continuous records until the seventeenth century, by which time the wo rst epidemics had probably already taken place. Furthermore, the British tended to drive the native populations away, rather than enslaving them as the Spaniards did, so that the epidemics of British America occurred beyond the range of colonists direct o bservation.  Even so, the surviving records of North America do contain references to deadly epidemics among the indigenous population. In 1616 -1619 an epidemic, possibly of bubonic or pneumonic plague, swept coastal New England, killing as many as nine out  of ten. During the 1630s smallpox, the disease most fatal to the Native American people, eliminated half the population of the Huron and Iroquois confederations. In the 1820s fever devastated the people of the Columbia River area, killing eight out of t en of them.     87  Unfortunately, the documentation of these and other epidemics is slight and frequently unreliable, and it is necessary to supplement what little we do know with evidence from recent epidemics among Native Americans. For example, in 1952 an outb reak of measles among the Native American inhabitants of Ungava Bay , Quebec, affected 99 percent of the population and killed 7 percent, even though some had the benefit of modern medicine.

This orthodox view of the universe  is now being challenged by astronomers who believe that a heavy rain of gas is falling into many galaxies from the supposedly empty space around them. The gas apparently condenses into a collection of small stars, each a little larger than the planet Ju piter. These stars vastly outnumber the other stars in a given galaxy. The amount of intergalactic rainfall into some of these galaxies has been enough to double their mass in the time since they formed. Scientists have begun to    89  suspect that this interga lactic gas is probably a mixture of gases left over from the big bang when the galaxies were formed and gas was forced out of galaxies by supernova explosions.  It is well known that when gas is cooled at a constant pressure its volume decreases. Thus, the physicist Fabian reasoned that as intergalactic gas cools, the cooler gas shrinks inward toward the center of the galaxy. Meanwhile its place is taken by hotter intergalactic gas from farther out on the edge of the galaxy, which cools as it is compressed  and flows into the galaxy. The net result is a continuous flow of gas, starting as hot gases in intergalactic space and ending as a drizzle of cool gas called a cooling flow, falling into the central galaxy.  A fairly heretical idea in the 1970s, the co oling-flow theory gained support when Fabian observed a cluster of galaxies in the constellation Perseus and found the central galaxy, NGC 1275, to be a strange -looking object with irregular, thin strands of gas radiating from it. According to previous spe culation, these strands were gases that had been blown out by an explosion in the galaxy. Fabian, however, disagreed. Because the strands of gas radiating from NGC 1275 are visible in optical photographs, Fabian suggested that such strands consisted not of gas blown out of the galaxy but of cooling flows of gas streaming inward. He noted that the wavelengths of the radiation emitted by a gas would changes as the gas cooled, so that as the gas flowed into the galaxy and became cooler, it would emit not x -rays, but visible light, like that which was captured in the photographs. Fabians hypothesis was supported by Canizares determination in 1982 that most of the gas in the Perseus cluster was at a temperature of 80 million degrees Kelvin, whereas the gas imme diately surrounding NGC 1275 (the subject of the photographs) was at one -tenth this temperature.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Th e Issei (first-generation immigrants) were brought into the Pajaro Valley to raise sugar beets. Like Issei laborers in American cities, Japanese men in rural areas sought employment via the boss system. The system comprised three elements: immigrant wage  laborers; Issei boardinghouses  where laborers stayed; and labor contractors, who gathered workers for a particular job and then negotiated a contract between workers and employer. This same system was originally utilized by the Chi nese laborers who had preceded the Japanese. A related institution was the labor club, which provided job information and negotiated employment contracts and other legal matters, such as the rental of land, for Issei who chose to belong and paid an annua l fee to the cooperative for membership.  When the local sugar beet industry collapsed in 1902, the Issei began to lease land from the valleys strawberry farmers. The Japanese provided the labor and the crop was divided between laborers and landowners. The  Issei thus moved quickly from wage -labor employment to sharecropping  agreements. A limited amount of economic progress was made as some Issei were able to rent or buy farmland directly, while others joined together to form farming corporations. As the Issei began to operate farms, they began to marry and start families, forming an established Japanese American community. Unfortunately, the Isseis efforts to attain agricultural independence were hampered by government restrictions, suc h as the Alien Land Law of 1913. But immigrants could circumvent such exclusionary laws by leasing or purchasing land in their American -born childrens names.  Nakanes case study  of one rural Japanese American community provides valuable information about the lives and experiences of the Issei. It is, however, too particularistic . This limitation derives from Nakanes methodology that of oral history which cannot substitute for a broader theoretical or comparative perspective.

The genes sequence of nucleotides is transcribed into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA), which reproduces the information contained in that sequence. Transported outside the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated into the protein it encodes by an organelle known as a ribosome, which strings together amino acids in the order specified by the sequence of elements in t he mRNA molecule. Since the amount of mRNA in a cell determines the amount of the corresponding protein, factors affecting the abundance of mRNAs play a major part in the normal functioning of a cell by appropriately regulating protein synthesis. For exam ple, an excess of certain proteins can cause cells to proliferate abnormally and become cancerous; a lack of the protein insulin results in diabetes.  Biologists once assumed that the variable rates at which cells synthesize different mRNAs determine the q uantities of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins in a cell. However, recent investigations have shown that the concentrations of most mRNAs correlate best, not with their synthesis rate, but rather with the equally variable rates at which cells degrad e the different mRNAs in their cytoplasm. If a cell degrades both a rapidly and a slowly synthesized mRNA slowly, both mRNAs will accumulate to high levels.  An important example of this phenomenon is the development of red blood cells from their unspecia lized parent cells in bone marrow . For red blood cells to accumulate sufficient concentrations of hemoglobin  (which transports oxygen) to carry out their main function, the cells parent cells must simultaneously pr oduce more of the constituent proteins of hemoglobin and less of most other proteins. To do this, the parent cells halt synthesis of non -hemoglobin mRNAs in the nucleus and rapidly degrade copies of the non -hemoglobin mRNAs remaining in the cytoplasm. Ha lting synthesis of mRNA alone would not affect the quantities of proteins synthesized by the mRNAs still existing in the cytoplasm.

Although both systems reduced reliance on skilled labor, Noble clearly prefers R/P, with its inherent acknowledgment of workers skills: unlike N/C, its programs were produced not by engineers at their computers, but by skilled machinists, wh o recorded their own movements to teach machines to duplicate those movements. However, Nobles only evidence of conspiracy is that, although the two approaches were roughly equal in technical merit, management chose N/C.

Rather, pain signals and pain reliefare delivered through a highly complex interacting circuitry.  When a cell is injured, a rush of prostaglandins sensitizes ne rve endings at the injury.    103  Prostaglandins are chemicals produced in and released from virtually all mammalian cells when they are injured: these are the only pain signals that do not originate in the nervous system. Aspirin and other similar drugs (such as  indomethacin and ibuprofen) keep prostaglandins from being made by interfering with an enzyme known as prostaglandin synthetase, or cyclooxygenase. The drugs effectiveness against pain is proportional to their success in blocking this enzyme at the site of injury.  From nerve endings at the injury, pain signa ls move to nerves feeding into the spinal cord . The long, tubular membranes of nerve cells carry electrical impulses. When electrical impulses get to the spinal cord, a pain -signaling chemical known as substance P is released there. Substance P then excites nearby neurons to send impulses to the br ain. Local anesthetics such as novocaine and xylocaine work by blocking the electrical transmission along nerves in a particular area. They inhibit the flow of sodium ions through the membranes, making the nerves electrically quiescent; thus no pain signal s are sent to the spinal cord or to the brain.  Recent discoveries in the study of pain have involved the brain itself the supervising organ that notices pain signals and that sends messages down to the spinal cord to regulate incoming pain traffic. Endorph insthe brains own morphine are a class of small peptides that help to block pain signals within the brain itself. The presence of endorphins may also help to explain differences in response to pain signals, since individuals seem to differ in their abili ty to produce endorphins.

However, if this were true, then one would exp ect Japanese auto plants in the United States to perform no better than factories run by United States companies. This is not the case; Japanese -run automobile plants located in the United States and staffed by local workers have demonstrated higher levels  of productivity when compared with factories owned by United States companies.  Other observers link high Japanese productivity to higher levels of capital investment per worker. But a historical perspective leads to a different conclusion. When the two to p Japanese automobile makers matched and then doubled United States productivity  levels in the mid-sixties, capital investment per employee was comparable to that of United States firms. Furthermore, by the late seventies, the amount of fixed assets requir ed to produce one vehicle was roughly equivalent in Japan and in the United States.  Since capital investment was not higher in Japan, it had to be other factors that led to higher productivity.

For instance, the mass-production philosophy of United States automakers encouraged the produ ction of huge lots of cars in order to utilize fully expensive, component -specific equipment and to occupy fully workers who have been trained to execute one operation efficiently. Japanese automakers chose to make small -lot production feasible by introduc ing several departures from United States practices, including the use of flexible equipment that could be altered easily to do several different production tasks and the training of workers in multiple jobs.

In recent studies, however, we have discovered that the production and release in brain neurons of the neurotransmitter serotonin  (neurotransmitters are compounds that neurons use to transmit signals to other c ells) depend directly on the food that the body processes.  Our first studies sought to determine whether the increase in serotonin observed in rats given a large injection of the amino acid tryptophan might also occur after rats ate meals that change trypt ophan levels in the blood. We found that, immediately after the rats began to eat, parallel elevations occurred in blood tryptophan, brain tryptophan, and brain serotonin levels. These findings suggested that the production and release of serotonin in brai n neurons were normally coupled with blood -tryptophan increases. In later studies we found that injecting insulin into a rats bloodstream also caused parallel elevations in blood and brain tryptophan levels and in serotonin levels. We then decided to see whether the secretion of the animals own insulin similarly affected serotonin production. We gave the rats a carbohydrate -containing meal that we knew would elicit insulin secretion. As we had hypothesized, the blood tryptophan level and the concentration s of tryptophan serotonin in the brain increased after the meal.  Surprisingly, however, when we added a large amount of protein to the meal, brain tryptophan and serotonin levels fell. Since protein contains tryptophan, why should it depress brain tryptoph an levels? The answer lies in the mechanism that provides blood tryptophan to the brain cells. This same mechanism also provides the brain cells with other amino acids found in protein, such as tyrosine and Leucine. The consumption of protein increases blo od concentration of the other amino acids much more, proportionately, than it does that of tryptophan. The more protein in the meal, the lower is the ratio of the resulting blood -tryptophan concentration to the concentration of competing amino acids, and t he more slowly is tryptophan provided to the brain.

The Supreme Court had issued its ruling in this epochal desegregation case a few months before Woodwards lectures.  The lectures were soon published a s a book , The Strange Career of Jim Crow . Ten years later, in a preface to the second revised edition , Woodward confessed with ironic modesty that the first edition had begun to suffer under some of the handicaps that might be expected in a history of the  American Revolution published in 1776. That was a bit like hearing Thomas Paine apologize for the timing of his pamphlet Common Sense , which had a comparable impact.

On the other hand, the true bacteria are prokaryotic cell , which are simple and lack a nucleus. The distinction between eukaryotes and bacteria, initially defined in terms of subcellular structures visible with a microscope, was ultimately carried to the molecular level. Here prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell s have many features in common. For instance, they translate genetic information into proteins according to the same type of genetic coding. But even where the molecular processes are the same, the details in the two forms are different and characteristic    115  of the respective forms. For example, the amino acid sequences of various enzymes tend to be typically prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The differences between the groups and the similarities within each group made it seem certain to most biologists that the tre e of life had only two stems. Moreover, arguments pointing out the extent of both structural and functional differences between eukaryotes and true bacteria convinced many biologists that the precursors of the eukaryotes must have diverged from the common ancestor before the bacteria arose.  Although much of this picture has been sustained by more recent research, it seems fundamentally wrong in one respect. Among the bacteria, there are organisms that are significantly different both from the cells of eukar yotes and from the true bacteria, and it now appears that there are three stems in the tree of life. New techniques for determining the molecular sequence of the RNA of organisms have produced evolutionary information about the degree to which organisms ar e related, the time since they diverged from a common ancestor, and the reconstruction of ancestral versions of genes. These techniques have strongly suggested that although the true bacteria indeed form a large coherent group, certain other bacteria, the archaebacteria , which are also prokaryotes and which resemble true bacteria, represent a distinct evolutionary branch that far antedates the common ancestor of all true bacteria.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

But in many cases the publics buying tastes simply change, leaving a manufacturer or distributor with thous ands (or millions) of items that the fickle public no longer wants.  One common way to dispose of  this merchandise is to sell it to a liquidator, who buys as cheaply as possible and then resells the merchandise through catalogs, discount stores, and other outlets . However, liquidators may pay less for the merchandise than it cost to make it. Another way to dispose of excess inventory is to dump it. The corporation takes a straight cost write-off on its taxes and hauls the merchandise to a landfill. Although it is hard to believe, there is a sort of convoluted logic to this approach. It is perfectly legal, requires little time or preparation on the compan ys part, and solves the problem quickly. The drawback is the remote possibility of getting caught by the news media.

Randolphs efforts in the battle helped transform the attitude of Black workers toward unions and toward themselves as an identifiable group; eventually, Randolph helped to weaken organized labors antagonism toward Black workers.

The Brotherhood possessed a number of advantages, however, including Randolphs own tactical abilities. In 1928 he took the bold step of threatening a strike against Pullman. Such a threat, on a national scale, under Black leader ship, helped replace the stereotype of the Black worker as servant with the image of the Black worker as wage earner . In addition, the porters very isolation aided the Brotherhood. Porters were scattered throughout the country, sleeping in dormitories in Black communities; their segregated life protected the unions internal communications from intercept ion. That the porters were a homogeneous group working for a single employer with single labor policy, thus sharing the same grievances from city to city, also strengthened the Brotherhood and encouraged racial identity and solidarity as well.

To explain this u nfinished revolution in the status of women, historians have recently begun to emphasize the way a prevailing definition of femininity often determines the kinds of work allocated to women, even when such allocation is inappropriate to new conditions. For instance, early textile -mill entrepreneurs, in justifying womens employment in wage labor, made much of the assumption that women were by nature  skillful at detailed tasks and patient in carrying out repetitive chores; the mill owners thus imported into the new industrial order hoary stereotypes associated with the homemaking activities they presumed to have been the purview of women. Because w omen accepted the more unattractive new industrial tasks more readily than did men, such jobs came to be regarded as female jobs. And employers, who assumed that womens real aspirations were for marriage and family life, declined to pay women wages comm ensurate with those of men. Thus many lower -skilled, lower -paid, less secure jobs came to be perceived as female.

The recently developed theory has considerable practical importance. Most of the gold deposits discovered during the original gold rushes were exposed at the Earths surface and were found because they had shed trails of alluvial gold  that were easily traced by simple prospecting  methods. Although these same methods still lead to an occasional discovery, most deposits not yet discovered have gone undetected because they are buried and have no surface express ion. The challenge in exploration is therefore to unravel the subsurface geology of an area and pinpoint the position of buried minerals. Methods widely used today include analysis of aerial images that yield a broad geological overview; geophysical techni ques that provide data on the    129  magnetic, electrical, and mineralogical properties of the rocks being investigated; and sensitive chemical tests that are able to detect the subtle chemical halos that often envelop mineralization. However, none of these high -technology methods are of any value if the sites to which they are applied have never mineralized, and to maximize the chances of discovery the explorer must therefore pay particular attention to selecting the ground formations most likely to be mineralize d. Such ground selection relies to varying degrees on conceptual models, which take into account theoretical studies of relevant factors.

By 1979, the total borrowings and losses of state -owned industries were running at about 3 billio n a year. By selling many of these industries, the government has decreased these borrowings and losses, gained over  34 billion from the sales, and now receives tax revenues from the newly privatized companies. Along with a dramatically improved overall e conomy, the government has been able to repay 12.5 percent of the net national debt over a two -year period.  In fact, privatization has not only rescued individual industries and a whole economy headed for disaster, but has also raised the level of performa nce in every area. At British Airways and British Gas, for example, productivity per employee has risen by 20 percent. At Associated British Ports, labor disruptions common in the 1970s and early 1980s have now virtually disappeared. At British Telecom, there is no longer a waiting list as there always was before privatization to have a telephone installed.  Part of this improved productivity has come about  because the employees of privatized industries were given the opp ortunity to buy shares in their own companies. They responded enthusiastically to the offer of shares; at British Aerospace, 89 percent of the eligible work force bought shares; at Associated British Ports, 90 percent; and at British Telecom, 92 percent.

Arguments in what could be called the relational femi nist tradition maintain the doctrine of equality in  difference, or equity as distinct for equality. They posit that biological distinctions between the sexes result in a necessary sexual division of labor  in the family and throughout society and that womens procreative  labor is currently undervalued by society, to the disadvantage of women. By contrast, the individualist feminist tradition emphasizes individual human rights and celebrates women s quest for personal autonomy, while downplaying the importance of gender roles and minimizing discussion of childbearing and its attendant  responsibilities.  Before  the late nineteenth century, these views coexisted within the feminist movement, often within the writings of the same individual. Between 1890 and 1920, however, relational feminism, which had been the dominant strain in feminist thought, and which still  predominates among European and non -Western feminists, lost ground in England and the United States. Because the concept of individual rights was already well established in the Anglo -Saxon legal and political tradition, individualist feminism came to pre dominate in English -speaking countries. At the same time, the goals of the two approaches began to seem increasingly irreconcilable. Individualist feminists began to advocate a totally gender -blind system with equal rights for all. Relational feminists, wh ile agreeing that equal educational and economic opportunities outside the home should be available for all women, continued to emphasize womens special contributions to society as homemakers and mothers; they demanded special treatment including protecti ve legislation for women workers, state -sponsored maternity benefits, and paid compensation for housework.  138 , ,      Relational arguments have a major pitfall: because they underline womens physiological and psychological distinctiveness, they are often appropriate d by political adversaries and used to endorse male privilege.

However, statistical analyses reveal that demographic changes in the workforce did not correlate with variations in the total number of temporary workers. Instead, these analyses suggest that factors affecting employers account for the rise in temporary employment.

Another factor is labors reduced bargaining strength, which allows employers more control over the terms of employment.

Scientists have advanced three theories of population control to account for this relative constancy.  The first theory attributes a relatively constant population to periodic climatic catastrophes that decimate populations with such frequency as to prevent them from exceeding some particular limit. In the case of small organisms with short life cycles, climatic changes need not be catastrophic: normal seasonal changes in photoperiod (daily amount of sunlight), for example, can govern population growth. This theory the density -independent view asserts that climatic factors exert the same regulatory effect on population regardless of the number of individuals in a region.  A second theory argues that population growth is primarily density -dependent that is, the rate of gr owth of a population in a region decreases as the number of animals increases. The mechanisms that manage regulation may vary. For example, as numbers increase, the food supply would probably diminish, which would increase mortality. In addition, as Lotka and Volterra have shown, predators can find prey more easily in high -density populations. Other regulators include physiological control mechanisms: for example , Christian and Davis have demonstrated how the crowding that results from a rise in numbers may  bring about hormonal changes in the pituitary and adrenal  glands that in turn may regulate population by lowering sexual activity and inhibiting sexual maturation. There is evidence that these effects may persist for three generations in the absence of th e original provocation. One challenge for density -dependent theorists is to develop models that would allow the precise prediction of the effects of crowding.  A third theory, proposed by Wynne -Edwards and termed epideictic , argues that organisms have evo lved a code in the form of social or epideictic behavior displays, such as winter -roosting aggregations or group vocalizing; such codes provide organisms with information on population size in a region so that they can, if necessary, exercise reproductiv e    143  restraint.

However, such a vertebrate society may exist among underground colonies of the highly social rodent Heterocephalus  glaber,  the naked mole rat.  A naked mole rat colony, like a beeh ive, wasps nest, or termite mound, is ruled by its queen, or reproducing female. Other adult female mole rats neither ovulate nor breed. The queen is the largest member of the colony, and she maintains her breeding status through a mixture of behavioral a nd, presumably, chemical control. Queens have been long -lived in 150 , ,      captivity, and when they die or are removed from a colony one sees violent fighting for breeding status among the larger remaining females, leading to a takeover by a new queen.  Eusocial inse ct societies have rigid caste systems, each insects role being defined by its behavior, body shape, and physiology. In naked mole rat societies, on the other hand, differences in behavior are related primarily to reproductive status (reproduction being li mited to the queen and a few males), body size, and perhaps age. Smaller non -breeding members, both male and female, seem to participate primarily in gathering food, transporting nest material, and tunneling. Larger non breeders are active in defending the colony and perhaps in removing dirt from the tunnels.

The first emphasizes the primordial and unc hanging character of ethnicity. In this view, people have an essential need for belonging that is satisfied by membership in groups based on shared ancestry and culture. A different conception of ethnicity de -emphasizes the cultural component and defines e thnic groups as interest groups. In this view, ethnicity serves as a way of mobilizing a certain population behind issues relating to its economic position. While both of these definitions are useful, neither fully captures the dynamic and changing aspects  of ethnicity in the United States. Rather, ethnicity is more satisfactorily conceived of as a process in which preexisting communal bonds and common cultural attributes are adapted for instrumental purposes according to changing real -life situations.  One example of this process is the rise of participation by Native American people in the broader United States political system since the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Besides leading Native Americans to participate more actively in politics (the numbe r of Native American legislative officeholders more than doubled), this movement also evoked increased interest in tribal history and traditional culture.

Antibodies are proteins synthesized by spe cialized cells called plasma cells, which are formed by lymphocytes (cells from the lymph system) when an antigen, a substance foreign to the organism s body, comes in contact with lymphocytes. Two important manifestations of antigen -antibody immunity are lysis, the rapid physical rupture of antigenic cells and the liberation of their contents into the surrounding medium, and phagocytosis, a process in which antigenic particles are engulfed by and very often digested by macrophages and polymorphs. The proce ss of lysis is executed by a complex and unstable blood constituent known as complement, which will not work unless it is activated by a specific antibody; the process of  phagocytosis is greatly facilitated when the particles to be engulfed are coated by a  specific antibody directed against them.  The reluctance to abandon this hypothesis, however well it explains specific processes, impeded new research, and for many years  antigens and antibodies dominated the thoughts of immunologists so completely that th ose immunologists overlooked certain difficulties. Perhaps  the primary difficulty with the antigen -antibody explanation is the informational problem of how an antigen is recognized and how a structure exactly complementary to it is then synthesized. When m olecular biologists discovered, moreover, that such information cannot flow from protein to protein, but only from nucleic acid to protein, the theory that an antigen itself provided the mold that directed the synthesis of an antibody had to be seriously q ualified. The attempts at qualification and the information provided by research in molecular biology led scientists to realize that a second immunological reaction is mediated through the lymphocytes that are hostile to and bring about the destruction of the antigen. This type of immunological response is called cell -mediated immunity.  Recent research in cell -mediated immunity has been concerned not only with the development of new and better vaccines, but also with the problem of transplanting tissues and  organs from  one organism to another, for although circulating antibodies play a part in the rejection of transplanted tissues, the primary role is played by cell -mediated reactions. During cell-mediated responses, receptor sites on specific lymphocytes an d surface antigens on the foreign tissue cells form a complex that binds the lymphocytes to the tissue. Such lymphocytes do not give rise to antibody -producing plasma cells but themselves bring about the death of the foreign -tissue cells, probably by secre ting a variety of substances, some of which are toxic to the tissue cells and some of which stimulate increased phagocytic activity by white blood cells of the macrophage type. Cell -mediated immunity also accounts for the destruction of intracellular paras ites.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

A nd they talked about education as essential to the public good a goal that took precedence over knowledge as occupational training or as a means to  self-fulfillment or self -improvement. Over and over again  the Revolutionary g eneration, both liberal and conservative in outlook, asserted its conviction that the welfare of the Republic rested upon an educated citizenry and that schools, especially free public schools, would be the best means of educating the citizenry in civic va lues and the  obligations required of everyone in a democratic republican society.  All agreed that the principal ingredients of a civic education  were literacy and the inculcation of patriotic and moral virtues, some others adding the study of    161  history and the study of principles of the republican government itself.  The founders, as was the case of almost all their successors, were long on exho rtation and rhetoric regarding the value of civic education, but they left it to the textbook writers to distill the essence of those values for school children. Texts in American history and government appeared as early as the 1790s. The textbook writers turned out to be very largely of conservative persuasion, more likely Federalist in outlook than Jeffersonian, and almost universally agreed that political virtue must rest upon moral and religious precepts. Since most textbook writers were New Englander, this meant that the texts were infused with Protestant and, above all, Puritan outlooks.  In the first half of the Republic, civic education in the schools emphasized the inculcation of civic values and made little attempt to develop participatory political  skills. That was a task left to incipient political parties, town meetings, churches and the coffee or ale houses where men gathered for conversation. Additionally as a reading of certain Federalist papers of the period would  demonstrate, the press probab ly did more to disseminate realistic as well as partisan knowledge of government than the schools. The goal of education, however, was to achieve a higher form of unum  for the new Republic. In the middle half of the nineteenth century, the political values taught in the public and private schools did not change substantially from those celebrated in the first fifty years of the Republic. In the textbooks of th e day their rosy hues if anything became golden. To the resplendent values of liberty, equality, and a benevolent Christian morality were now added the middle -class virtues -especially of New England -of hard work, honesty and integrity, the rewards of indiv idual effort, and obedience to parents and legitimate authority.

One of the least u nderstood involves the peculiar roles of producer or provider  and purchaser or consumer  in the typical doctor -patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various inducements of p rice, quality, and utility, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Where circumstances permit the buyer no choice because there is effectively  only one seller and the product is relatively essential, government usually asserts m onopoly and places the industry under price and other regulations. Neither of these conditions prevails in most of the health -care industry.  In the health -care industry, the doctor -patient relationship is the mirror image  of the ordinary relationship  between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician and even then there may be no real choice it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should retu rn next Wednesday,  whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is a rare and sophisticated patient who will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance  questions about price, especially when the ailment is regarded as serious.  This is particularly significant in relation to  hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedu res will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The  patient may be consulted about some of these decisions, but in the main  it is the doctor s judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eyes of  the hospital it is the physician who is the real  consumer . As a consequence,  the medical staff represents the power center  in hospital policy and decision -making, not the administration.  Although usually there are in this s ituation four identifiable participants the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government) the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bona fide  bills generated by the physician/hospital; and for the most part  the patient plays a passive role. In routine or minor illnesses, or just plain worries, the patient s options are, of course, much greater with respect to  use and price. In illnesses that are of some significance, however, such choices tend to evaporate , and it is for these il lnesses that the bulk of the health -care dollar is spent.

The shock waves heat the interstellar gas, evaporate small clou ds, and compress larger ones to the point at which they collapse under their own gravity to form new stars. The general picture that has been developed for the supernova explosion and its aftermath goes something like this. Throughout its evolution, a star  is much like a leaky balloon. It keeps its equilibrium figure through a balance of internal pressure against the tendency to collapse under its own weight. The pressure is generated by nuclear reactions in the core of the star which must continually suppl y energy to balance the energy that leaks out  in the form of radiation. Eventually the nuclear fuel is exhausted, and the pressure drops in the core. With nothing to hold it up, the matter in the 166 , ,      center of the star collapses inward, creating higher and higher densities and temperatures, until the nuclei and electrons are fused into a super -dense lump of matter known as a neutron star.  As the overlying layers rain down  on the surface of the neutron star, the temperature rises, until with a  blinding flash of radiation, the collaps e is reversed. A thermonuclear  shock wave runs through the now expanding stellar envelope, fusing lighter elements into heavier ones and producing a brilliant visual outburst that can be as intense as the light of 10 billion s uns. The shell of matter thrown off by the explosion plows through the surrounding gas, producing an expanding bubble of hot gas, with gas temperatures in the millions of degrees. This gas will emit most of its energy at X -ray wavelengths, so it is not sur prising that X -ray observatories have provided some of the most useful insights into the nature of the supernova phenomenon. More than twenty supernova remnants have now been detected in X -ray studies.  Recent discoveries of meteorites with anomalous concen trations of certain isotopes indicate that a supernova might have precipitated the birth of our solar system more than four and a half billion years ago. Although the cloud that collapsed to form the Sun and the planets was composed primarily of hydrogen a nd helium, it also contained carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, elements essential for life as we know it. Elements heavier than helium are manufactured deep in the interior of stars and would, for the most part , remain there if it were not for the cataclysmic supernova explosions that blow giant stars apart.

As early as the 1860s, there were count er movements to the traditional orientation. Yukichi Fukuzawa, the most eloquent spokesman of Japan s Enlightenment,  claimed: The Confucian civilization of the East seems to me to lack two things possessed by Western civilization: science in the materia l sphere and a sense of independence in the spiritual sphere.  Fukuzawa s great influence is found in the free and individualistic philosophy of the Education Code of 1872, but he was not able to prevent the government from turning back to the canons of Confucian thought in the Imperial Rescript  of 1890. Another interlude of relative liberalism followed World War I, when the democratic idealism of President Woodrow Wilson had an important impact on Japanese intellectuals and, especially students: but more i mportant was the Leninist ideology of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Again in the early 1930s, nationalism and militarism became dominant, largely as a result of failing economic conditions.  Following the end of World War II, substantial changes were under taken in Japan to liberate the individual from authoritarian restraints. The new democratic value system was accepted by many teachers, students, intellectuals, and old liberals, but it was not immediately embraced by the society as a whole. Japanese tradi tions were dominated by group values, and notions of personal freedom and individual rights were unfamiliar.  Today, democratic processes are clearly evident in the widespread participation of the Japanese people in social and political life: yet, there is no universally accepted and stable value system. Values are constantly modified by strong infusions of Western ideas, both democratic and Marxist. School textbooks expound democratic principles, emphasizing equality over hierarchy  and rationalism over trad ition; but in practice these values are often misinterpreted and distorted, particularly by the youth who translate the individualistic and humanistic goals of democracy into egoistic and materialistic ones.  Most Japanese people have consciously rejected C onfucianism, but vestiges of the old order remain. An important feature of relationships in many institutions such as political parties, large corporations, and university faculties is the oyabun -kobun  or parent -child relation. A party leader, supervisor, or professor, in return for loyalty, protects those subordinate to him and takes general responsibility for their interests throughout their entire lives, an obligation that    169  sometimes even extends to arranging marriages. The corresponding loyalty of the in dividual to his patron reinforces his allegiance to the group to which they both belong. A willingness to cooperate with other members of the group and to  support without qualification the interests of the group in all its external relations is still a wid ely respected virtue. The oyabun -kobun  creates ladders of mobility which an individual can ascend, rising as far as abilities permit, so long as he maintains successful personal ties with a  superior in the vertical channel, the latter requirement usually t aking precedence over a need for exceptional competence.

Later, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the infirmary separated from the almshouse and became an independent institution supported by local tax money. At the same time, private charity hospitals began to develop. Both  private and public hospitals provided mainly food and shelter for the impoverished sick, since there was little that medicine could actually do to cure illness, and the middle class was treated at home by private physicians.  Late in the nineteenth century , the private charity hospital began trying to attract middle -class patients. Although the depression of 1890 stimulated the growth of charitable institutions and an expanding urban population became dependent on assistance, there was a decline in private contributions to these organizations which forced them to look to local government for financial support. Since private institutions had also lost benefactors; they began to charge patients. In order to attract middle -class patients, private institutions p rovided services and amenities that distinguished between paying and non -paying patients and made the hospital a desirable place for private physicians to treat their own patients. As paying patients became more necessary to the survival of the private hos pital, the public hospitals slowly became the only place for the poor to get treatment. By the end of the nineteenth century, cities were reimbursing private hospitals for their care of indigent patients and the public hospitals remained dependent on the t ax dollars.  The advent of private hospital health insurance, which provided middle -class patients with the purchasing power to pay for private hospital services, guaranteed the private hospital a regular source of income. Private hospitals restricted thems elves to revenue -generating patients, leaving the public hospitals to care for the poor. Although public hospitals continued to provide services for patients with communicable diseases and outpatient and emergency services, the Blue Cross  plans developed around the needs of the private hospitals and the inpatients they served. Thus, reimbursement for ambulatory care has been minimal under most Blue Cross plans, and provision of outpatient care has not been a major function of the p rivate hospital, in part because private patients can afford to pay for the services of private physicians. Additionally, since World War II, there has been a tremendous influx of federal money into private medical schools and the hospitals associated with  them. Further, large private medical centers with expensive research equipment and programs have attracted the best administrators, physicians, and researchers. As a result of the greater resources available to the private medical centers, public hospital s have increasing problems attracting highly qualified research and medical personnel.

The le gislation had been a year -and-a-half in the making beginning when President Truman first recommended that the armed services be reorganized into a single department. During that period the President s concept of a unified armed service was torn apart and p ut back together several times, the final measure to emerge from Congress being a compromise. Most of the opposition to the bill came from the Navy and its numerous civilian spokesmen, including Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. In support of unification (and a separate air force that was part of the unific ation package) were the Army air forces, the Army, and, most importantly, the President of the United States.  174 , ,      Passage of the bill did not bring an end to the bitter interservice disputes. Rather than unify, the act served only to federate  the military services. It neither halted the rapid demobilization of the armed forces that followed World War II nor brought to the new national military establishment the loyalties of officers steeped in the traditions of the separate services. A t a time when the balance of power in Europe and Asia was rapidly shifting, the services lacked any precise statement of United States foreign policy from the National Security Council on which to base future programs. The services bickered unceasingly ove r their respective roles and missions, already complicated by the Soviet nuclear capability that for the first time made the United States subject to devastating attack. Not even the appointment of Forrestal as First Secretary of Defense allayed the suspic ions of naval officers and their supporters that the role of the U.S. Navy was threatened with permanent eclipse. Before the war of words died down, Forrestal himself was driven to resignation and then suicide.  By 1948, the United States military establish ment was forced to make do with a budget approximately 10 percent of what it had been at its wartime peak. Meanwhile, the cost of weapons procurement was rising geometrically as the nation came to put more and more reliance on the atomic bomb and its deliv ery systems. These two factors inevitably made adversaries of the Navy and the Air Force as the battle between advocates of the B -36 and the supercarrier so amply demonstrates. Given severe fiscal restraints on the one hand, and on the other the nation s increasing reliance on strategic nuclear deterrence, the conflict between these two services over roles and missions was essentially a contest over slices of an ever-diminishing pie.  Yet if in the end neither service was the obvious victor, the principle of  civilian dominance over the military clearly was. If there had ever been any danger that the United States military establishment might exploit, to the detriment of civilian control, the goodwill it enjoyed as a result of its victories in World War II, th at danger disappeared in the interservice animosities engendered by the battle over unification.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Human beings rely primarily on the first to provide a hospitable thermal microclimate  for themselves, in which the transfer of heat between the body and  the environment is accomplished with minimal involvement of innate mechanisms of heat production and loss. Thermoregulatory  behavior anticipates hyperthermia, and the organism adjusts its behavior to avoid becoming hyperthermic: it removes layers of clothing, it goes for a cool swim, etc. The organism can also respond to changes in the temperature of the body core, as is the case during exercise; but such responses result from the direct stimulation of thermoreceptor s distributed widely within the central nervous system , and the ability of these mechanisms to help the organism adjust to gross changes in its environment is limited.  Until recently it was assumed that organisms respond to microwave radiation in the same way that they respond to temperature changes ca used by other forms of radiation. After all, the argument runs, microwaves are radiation and heat body tissues. This theory ignores the fact that the stimulus to a behavioral response is normally a temperature change that occurs at the surface of the organ ism. The thermoreceptors that prompt behavioral changes are located within the first millimeter of the skin s surface, but the energy of a microwave field  may be    177  selectively deposited in deep tissues, effectively bypassing these thermoreceptors, particularly if the field is at near -resonant frequencies. The resulting temperature profile  may well be a kind of reve rse thermal gradient in which the deep tissues are warmed more than those of the surface. Since the heat is not conducted outward to the surface to stimulate the appropriate receptors, the organism does not appreciate  this stimulation in the same way tha t it appreciates  heating and cooling of the skin. In theory , the internal organs of a human being or an animal could be quite literally cooked well-done before the animal even realizes that the balance of its thermomicroclimate has been disturbed.  Until a few years ago, microwave i rradiations at equivalent plane -wave power densities of about 100 mW/cm2 were considered unequivocally to produce thermal  effects; irradiations within the range of 10 to 100 mW/cm2 might or might not produce thermal  effects; while effects observed at p ower densities below 10 mW/cm2 were assumed to be nonthermal  in nature. Experiments have shown this to be an oversimplification, and a recent report suggests that fields as weak as 1 mW/cm2 can be thermogenic. When the heat generated in the tissues by an  imposed radio frequency  (plus the heat generated by metabolism) exceeds the heat -loss capabilities of the organism, the thermoregulatory system has been compromised.

These include better access to health care (particularly for the  poor and minorities), improvements in physical plants, and increased numbers of physicians and other health personnel. All have played a part in the recent improvement in life expectancy . But there is mounting criticism of the large remaining gaps in access, unbridled cost inflation, the further fragmentation of service, excessive indulgence in wasteful high -technology gadgeteering,  and a breakdown in doctor -patient relationships. In recent years  proposed panaceas and new programs, small and large, have proliferated at a feverish pace and disappointments multiply at almost the same rate. This has led to an increased pessimism everythin g has been tried and nothing works which sometimes borders on cynicism or even nihilism.  It is true that the automatic pass through  of rapidly spiraling costs  to government and insurance carriers, which was set in a publicize d environment of the richest nation in the world,  produced for a time  a sense of unlimited resources and allowed to develop a mood whereby every practitioner and institution could do his own thing  without undue concern for the Medical Commons.  The practice of full -cost reimbursement encouraged capital investment and now the industry is overcapitalized. Many cities have hundreds of excess hospital beds; hospitals have proliferated a superabundance of high -technology equipment; and structural ostentation and luxury were the order of the day . In any given day, one -fourth of all community beds are vacant; expensive equipment is underused or, worse, used unnecessarily. Capital investment brings rapidly rising operating costs .

Hence, it was widely thought that novels by women should be modest, religious, sensitive, guileless, and chaste, like their authors. Many Victorian women writers took exception to this belief, however, resisting the imposition of nonliterar y restrictions on their work. Publishers soon discovered that the gentlest and most iddylike female novelists were tough -minded and relentless when their professional integrity  was at stake . Keenly aware of their artistic responsibilities, these women writers would not make concessions to secure commercial success.  The Brontes, George Eliot, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and their lesser -known 182 , ,      contemporaries repudiated, in their profe ssional lives, the courtesy that Victorian ladies might exact from Victorian gentlemen. Desiring rigorous and impartial criticism, most women writers did not wish reviewers to be kind to them if kindness meant overlooking their literary weaknesses or flatt ering them on their accomplishments simply because of their sex. They had expected derisive reviews; instead, they found themselves confronted with generous criticism, which they considered condescending. Elizabeth Barrett Browning labeled it the comparat ive respect which means... absolute scorn.  For their part, Victorian critics  were virtually obsessed with finding the place of the woman writer so as to judge her appropriately. Many bluntly admitted that they thought Jane Eyre  a masterpiece if written by  a man, shocking or disgusting if written by a woman. Moreover, reactionary reviewers were quick to associate an independent heroine with carefully concealed revolutionary doctrine; several considered Jane Eyre  a radical feminist document, as indeed it was. To Charlotte Bronte, who had demanded dignity and independence without any revolutionary intent and who considered herself politically conservative, their criticism was an affront. Such criticism bunched all women writers together rather than treating th em as individual artists.  Charlotte Bronte s experience served as a warning to other women writers about the prejudices that immediately associated them with feminists and others thought to be political radicals. Irritated, and anxious to detach themselves  from a group stereotype, many expressed relatively conservative views on the emancipation of women (except on the subject of women s education) and stressed their own domestic accomplishments. However, in identifying themselves with women who had chosen t he traditional career path of marriage and motherhood, these writers encountered still another threat to their creativity. Victorian prudery rendered virtually all experience that was uniquely feminine unprintable. No nineteenth -century woman dared to desc ribe childbirth, much less her sexual passion. Men could not write about their sexual experiences either, but they could write about sport, business, crime, and war all activities from which women were barred.

As long as those who worked the land were  barely able to ensure their own subsistence  and that of their landlords, all other activities had to be minimal, but when food surpluses increased, it became possible to release more people for governmental, commercial, religious and cultural pursuits.  However, not all the funds from the agricultural surplus were actually available for commercial investment. Much of the surplus, in the form of food increases, probably went to raise the subsis tence level; an additional amount, in the form of currency gained from the sale of food, went into the royal treasury to be used in waging war. Although Louis VII of France levied a less crushing tax burden on his subjects than did England s Henry  II, Loui s VII did spend great sums on an unsuccessful crusade, and his vassals both lay and ecclesiastic took over spending where their sovereign stopped. Surplus funds were claimed both by the Church and by feudal landholders, whereupon  cathedrals and castles mushroomed throughout France.     185  The simultaneous progress of cathedral building and, for instance, vineyard expansion in Bordeaux  illustrates the very real competition for avai lable capital between the Church and commercial interests; the former produced inestimable moral and artistic riches, but the latter had a stronger immediate impact upon gross national product. Moreover, though all wars by definition are defensive, the fre quent crossings of armies that lived off  the land and impartially burned all the huts and barns on their path consumed considerable resources.  Since demands on the agricultural surplus would have varied from year to year , we cannot precisely calculate t heir impact on the commercial growth of medieval France. But we must bear that impact in mind when estimating the assets that were likely to have been available for investment. No doubt castle and cathedral building was not totally barren of profit (for th e builders, that is), and it produced intangible dividends of material and moral satisfaction for the community. Even wars handed back  a fragment of what they took, at least to a few. Still, we cannot place on the same plane a primarily destructive activity and a constructive one, nor expect the same results from a new bell tower as from a new water mill . Above all, medieval France had little room for investment over and above the  preservation of life. Granted that war cost much less  than it does today, that the Church rendered all sorts of educational and recreational services that were unobtainable elsewhere , and that government was far less demanding than is the modern state nevertheless, for medieval men and women, supporting commercial development required considerable economic sacrifice.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Brazil never developed a system of rigid segregation of the sort  that replaced slavery in the United States, and it s racial system was fluid because its definition of race was based as much on characteristics such as economic status as on skin color. Until recently, the most persuasive explanation for these differences was that Portuguese institutions especially the Ro man Catholic church and Roman civil law , promoted recognition of the slave s humanity. The English colonists, on the other  hand, constructed their system of slavery out of whole cloth . There were simply no preceden ts in English common law , and separation of church and state barred Protestant clergy from the role that priests assumed in Brazil.  But the assumption that institutions alone could so powerfully affect the history of two raw and malleable  frontier  countries seems, on reexamination, untenable. Recent studies focus instead on a particular set of contrasting economic circumstances and demographic profiles at 188 , ,      significant periods in the h istories of the two countries. Persons of mixed race quickly appeared in both countries. In the United States they were considered to be Black, a social definition that was feasible because they were in the minority. In Brazil, it was not feasible. Though intermarriage was illegal in both countries, the laws were unenforceable in Brazil since Whites formed a small minority in an overwhelmingly Black population. Manumission for persons of mixed race was also easier in Brazil, particularly in the nineteenth c entury when in the United States it was hedged about with difficulties. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled workers in Brazil provided persons of mixed race with the opportunity to learn crafts and trades, even before general emancipation, whereas in the Un ited States entry into these occupations was blocked by Whites sufficiently numerous to fill the posts. The consequence was the development in Brazil of a large class of persons of mixed race, proficient in skilled trades and crafts, who stood waiting as a  community for freed slaves to join.  There should be no illusion that Brazilian society after emancipation was color -blind. Rather, the large population of persons of mixed race produced a racial system that included a third status, a bridge between the Bl ack caste and the White, which could be traversed by means of economic or intellectual achievement, marriage, or racial heritage. The strict and sharp line between the races so characteristic of the United States in the years immediately after emancipation  was simply absent. With the possible exception of New Orleans, no special place developed in the United States for persons of mixed race.

Such ecological deterioration in the Sahel  has been linked in several ways to the increased size of livestock herds. During the fifteen years preceding 1968, a period of extremely favorable rainfall, the pastoralists  moved into the marginal regions in the north with relatively large herds. However, with the onset of a series of dry years begin ning at the end of the rainy season in 1967, the pastoral populations found themselves overtaxing very marginal rangelands, with the result that the nomads viewed themselves as victims of a natural disaster. The mistaken idea that drought is an unexpected event has often been used to excuse the fact that long -range planning has failed to take rainfall variability into account. People blame the climate for agricultural failures in semiarid regions and make it a scapegoat for faulty population and agricultura l policies.  Deterioration and ultimately desertification in the Sahel and in other ecosystems can be combated only if an ecologically realistic carrying capacity for the rangelands is determined. Although there appears to be widespread agreement that such a determination would be significant, there has been little agreement on how to make operational the concept of carrying capacity, defined as the amount of grazing stock that the pasture can support without deterioration of either the pasture or the stock.  Should the carrying capacity  be geared to the best, the average, or the poorest years? Which combination of statistical measures would be most meaningful for the planning of long -term development of rangelands? On which variables should such an assessment be based, vegetation, rainfall, soil, ground and surface water, or managerial capabilities? Such inconclusiveness within the scientific community, while understandable, creates confusion for the land managers, who often decide to take no action or who decide that all scientific suggestions are of equal weight and, therefore, indiscriminately    191  choose any one of those suggested. Given the downward spiral of land deterioration, it becomes essential that an ecologically acceptable carry ing capacity be established and enforced.  It will also be crucial that land managers know what statistical and quasi -statistical measures actually mean: no single number can adequately describe the climate regime of an arid or semiarid region. Land manager s must supplement such terms as the mean  with more informative statistical measures to characterize adequately the variability of the climate.

Many innovations that were once heavily supported and publicized, such as fish -protein concentrate and protein from algae grown on petroleum    193  substrates, have since fallen by the wayside. The proposals themselves were technically feasible, but they proved to be economically unviable and to yield food products culturally unacceptable to their consumers. Recent innovations such as opaque -2 maize, Antarctic krill, and the wheat -rye hybrid triticale  seem more promising, but it is too early to predict their ultimate fate.  One characteristic common to unsuccessful food innovations has been that, even with extensive government support, they often have not been technologically ada pted or culturally acceptable to the people for whom they had been developed. A successful new technology, therefore, must fit the entire sociocultural system in which it is to find a place. Security of crop yield, practicality of storage, palatability, an d costs are much more significant than had previously been realized by the advocates of new technologies. For example, the better protein quality in tortillas  made from opaque -2 maize will be of only limited benefit to a family on the margin of subsistence if the new maize is not culturally acceptable or is more vulnerable to insects.  The adoption of new food technologies depends on more than these techni cal and cultural considerations; economic factors and governmental policies also strongly influence the ultimate success of any innovation. Economists in the Anglo -American tradition have taken the lead in investigating the economics of technological innov ation. Although they exaggerate in claiming that profitability is the key factor guiding technical change they completely disregard the substantial effects of culture they are correct in stressing the importance of profits. Most technological innovations i n agriculture can be fully used only by large landowners and are only adopted if these profit -oriented business people believe that the innovation will increase their incomes. Thus, innovations that carry high rewards for big agribusiness groups will be ad opted even if they harm segments of the population and reduce the availability of food in a country.  Further, should a new technology promise to alter substantially the profits and losses associated with any production system, those with economic power wil l strive to maintain and improve their own positions. Since large segments of the populations of many developing countries are close to the subsistence margin and essentially powerless, they tend to be the losers in this system unless they are aided by a g overnment policy that takes into account the needs of all sectors of the economy.

In the Middle Ages, however, the practice of ransoming, or returning prisoners in exchange for  money,  became common. Though some saw this custom as 196 , ,      a step towards a more humane society, the primary reasons behind it were economic rather than humanitarian.  In those times, rulers had only a limited ability to raise taxes. The y could neither force their subjects to fight nor pay them to do so. The promise of material compensation in the form of goods and ransom was therefore the only way of inducing combatants to participate in a war. In the Middle Ages , the predominant incentive for the individual soldier to participate in a war was the expectation of spoils. Although collecting ransom clearly brought financial gain, keeping a prisoner and arranging for his exchange had its costs. Consequent ly, several procedures were devised to reduce transaction costs.  One such device was a rule asserting that the prisoner had to assess his own value. This compelled the prisoner to establish a value without much distortion; indicating too low a value would increase the captive s chances of being killed, while indicating too high a value would either ruin him financially or create a prohibitively expensive ransom that would also result in death.  A second means of reducing costs was the practice of releasing a  prisoner on his word of honor . This procedure was advantageous to both parties since the captor was relieved of the expense of keeping the prisoner while the captive had freedom of movement. The captor also benefited fi nancially by having his captive raise the ransom himself. This parole  was a viable practice since the released prisoner risked recapture or retaliation against his family. Moreover, in medieval society, breaking one s word  had serious consequences. When, for example, King Francois I broke his word to the Emperor Charles V in 1525, his reputation suffered immensely.  A third method of reducing costs was the use of specialized institutions to establish contact between the two par ties. Two types of institutions emerged: professional dealers who acted as brokers, and members of religious orders  who acted as neutral intermediaries. Dealers advanced money for the ransom and charged interest on the loan. Two of the religious orders that became intermediaries were the Mercedarians and the Trinitarians, who between them arranged the ransom of nearly one million prisoners.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Stress builds up  until a fracture forms at a depth of a fe w kilometers and the crust slips to relieve the stress. Some earthquakes, however, take place hundreds of kilometers down in the Earth s mantle, where high pressure makes rock so ductile that it flows instead of cracking, even under stress severe enough to  deform it like putty. How can there be earthquakes at such depths?  That such deep events do occur has been accepted only since 1927, when the seismologist Kiyoo  Wadati convincingly demonstrated their existence. Instead of comparing the arrival times of seismic waves at different locations, as earlier researchers had done. Wadati relied on a time difference between the arrival of primary (P) waves and the slower secondary (S) waves. Because P and S waves travel at different but fairly constant speeds, the i nterval between their arrivals increases in proportion to  the distance from the earthquake focus , or rupture point.  For most earthquakes, Wadati discovered, the interval was quite short near the epicenter , the point on the surface where shaking is strongest. F or a few events, however, the delay was long even at the epicenter. Wadati saw a similar pattern when he analyzed data on the intensity    199  of shaking. Most earthquakes had a small area of intense shaking, which weakened rapidly with increasing distance from t he epicenter, but others were characterized by a lower peak intensity, felt over a broader area. Both the P -S intervals and the intensity patterns suggested two kinds of earthquakes: the more common shallow events, in which the focus lay just under the epicenter, and deep events, with a focus several hundred kilometers down.  The question remained: how can such quakes occur, given  that mantle rock at a depth of more than 50  kilometers is too ductile to store enough stress to fracture? Wadati s work suggested that deep events occur in areas (now called Wadati -Benioff zones) where one crustal plate is forced under anoth er and descends into the mantle. The descending rock is substantially cooler than the surrounding mantle and hence is less ductile and much more liable to fracture.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

This upward mobility , historians have argued, allowed England to escape the clash between those with social/political power and those with economic power, a conflict that beset the rest of Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Upward mobility was also used t o explain England s exceptional stability since the late seventeenth century (no revolutions, for example), as well as such major events as the development of the most efficient agricultural system in Europe, the making of the first industrial revolution, and the onset of severe economic decline.  But is the thesis true? Recent work on the supposed consequences of an open elite has already produced some doubts. Little credence, for example, is now accorded the idea that England s late nineteenth -century econ omic decline resulted from absentee business owners too distracted by the demands of elite life to manage their firms properly. But, although the importance of an open elite to other major events has been severely questioned, it is only with a new work by Lawrence and Jeanne Stone that the openness itself has been confronted. Eschewing the tack of tracing the careers of successful entrepreneurs to gauge the openness of the elite, the Stones chose the alternative approach of analyzing the elite itself, and proceeded via the ingenious route of investigating country -house ownershi p. Arguing that ownership of a country house was seen as essential for membership in the ruling elite, the Stones analyze the nature of country -house ownership in three counties for the period 1540 -1880. Their critical findings are provocative: there was s trikingly little change in the ownership of such houses throughout the period. Instead, even in the face of a demographic crisis (fewer marriages, declining fertility, rising infant mortality), the old elite was able to maintain itself, and its estates, in tact for centuries through recourse to various marriage and inheritance strategies. The popular picture of venerable elite families overcome by debt and selling out to merchants is simply not borne out  by the Stones  findings. Rather, the opportunities for entrepreneurs to buy their way into the elite, the Stones show, were extremely limited. If further studies of country -house ownership attest to  the representativeness and accu racy of their data, then the Stones  conclusion that the open elite thesis cannot be maintained may, indeed, prove true.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

This worth should be determined by an evaluation system  that rates jobs according to their social importance and skill requirements. Because comparable worth does not attack all forms of inequality, it can have only a  modest direct effect on the overall degree of inequality in society, but in attacking gender inequality in the job classification system it attacks a major component of gender inequality in the United States. The likelihood that other forms of inequality will become more manifest with the lessening of gender inequality is not a valid argument against comparable worth. Indeed, struggles for comparable worth may help launch campaigns against similar forms of inequity. Still, while conservatives have battled hard against comparable worth, radicals have been reluctant to fight for it because they see the narrow presentations in comparable worth litigation as the limits of the concept. But in addition to helping redress particular inequities, comparable worth co uld open a discussion of the entire  wage system. Its theoretical and political impact will reach far beyond the framework in which it was conceived and force a rethinking of assumptions underlying current employment practices and the market itself.  How com parable worth will affect the hierarchy of wages is more difficult to foresee. It does not directly challenge the concept of a hierarchy; in fact, its insistence that jobs must be evaluated implies a hierarchy. However, its rejection of the market as an ad equate basis for determining wages initiates a discussion of how value should be assigned to jobs. Advocates of comparable worth have challenged prevailing standards of evaluation, which them from formal job ovalions first developed in industrial settings.  These evaluations, based on points awarded for different job tasks, gave considerable emphasis to such activities as strenuous lifting and the operation of expensive equipment. Consequently, the skills and knowledge more typical of work done by women are less heavily emphasized. The `Dictionary of Occupational Titles  reveals numerous current instances of such imbalance in job ratings.  While comparable -worth advocates accept the principle of a hierarchy of wages, arguing only that they seek more objective measures of job worth, the issues they raise provoke a broader debate. This debate does not, as the opponents have claimed, concern the feasibility of setting up and applying evaluative standards. Employers have done that for centuries.

Yet in his recent book, historian J. G. A. Pocock argues that early American culture was actually rooted in the writings of Machiavelli, not Locke. The implications of this substitution are important: if  Pocock s argument is right, then Americans may not be  as deeply individualistic and capitalistic as many believe.  Pocock argues that out of the writings of antiquity Machiavelli created a body of political thinking called classical republicanism.  This b ody of thought revived the ancient belief that a human being was by nature a citizen who achieved moral fulfillment by participating in a self-governing republic. Liberty was interpreted as a condition that is realized when people are virtuous and are will ing to sacrifice their individual interests for the sake of the community. To be completely virtuous, people had to be independent and free of the petty interests of the marketplace. The greatest enemy of virtue was commerce. This classical republican trad ition is said by Pocock to have shaped the ideology of America during the eighteenth century.  Many events in early American history can be reinterpreted in light of Pocock s analysis. Jefferson is no longer seen as a progressive reader of Locke leading Ame rica into its individualistic future; instead Jefferson is understood as a figure obsessed with virtue and corruption and fearful  of new commercial developments. Influenced by Pocock, some historians have even argued that a communitarian and precapitalist mentality was pervasive among the eighteenth -century farmers of America.  Yet Pocock s thesis and the reinterpretation of the history of eighteenth -century America engendered by it are of dubious validity. If Americans did believe in the ideals of classical  virtue that stressed civic duty and made the whole community greater than its discrete parts, then why did the colonists lack a sense of obligation to support the greater good of the British Empire? If indeed America  has not always been the society of ind ividual rights and self -interest that it is today, how and when did it be  come so? Classical republicanism is elitist, and it certainly had little to offer the important new social groups of artisans and shopkeepers that emerged in America during the eight eenth century. These middle -class radicals, for whom John Wilkes and Thomas Paine were spokesmen, had none of the independence from the market that the landed gentry had. They were less concerned with virtue and community than they were with equality and p rivate rights. They hated political privilege and wanted freedom from an elite -dominated state.

Accretion disks exist in a variety of situations where matters swirl around  a compact star such as a white dwarf star or a neutron star. Accretion disks are also suspected of playing a part in  more exotic situations, in which the central object is imagined to be a supermassive black hole, the ultimate form of collapsed matter, ra ther than a compact star. The modeling of accretion disks is still in its infancy, a situation analogous to the days when ordinary stars were modeled by using elementary scaling laws without benefit of knowledge of the nuclear processes that power the star s. Similarly, the basic physics of the power by which accretion disks radiate, thought to or iginate in a form of turbulent friction, is known only at the crudest level. Accretion disks were first defined in the context of Cataclysmic variables. In these sy stems, matter from the outer layers of an ordinary star is attracted by the gravitational influence of a nearby orbiting white dwarf star, the matter lost from the ordinary star cannot strike the surface of the tiny white dwarf directly but settles into an  orbit around the star. The viscosity in the disk thus formed causes heating, radiation, and a slow spiraling of disk matter onto the surface of the white dwarf.  The rapid advances made in x -ray astronomy in the past decade have identified a second type of  system in which accretion disks occur. In such a system, an accretion disk whirls about a neutron star rather than a white  dwarf. The inner reaches of the accretion disk extend deeply into the gravitational potential of the neutron star where very rapid m otion is the rule. The energy released by friction and the actual raining of the material from the disk onto the surface of the neutron star is so great that radiation is given off in a powerful flood of x -rays. And in at least one case, x -ray astronomers believe that the object in the center of an accretion disk is a black hole, suggesting that a third system may exist.  It had been assumed that portions of accretion disks would be unstable and that, as a result, clumping of their matter into rings would oc cur. There is no evidence from observation, however, that accretion disks do, in fact, suffer from these instabilities. In recent work, Abramowicz has shown that added gravitational effects due to general relativity may alter the expected Newtonian gravita tional relationships in such a way that the disk remains stable, indicating that it is possible that these predicted instabilities do not occur.  Further progress toward understanding accretion disks will involve defining and proposing solutions to restrict ed problems just as was done in this case and was done and continues to be done for ordinary stars.

Scholars have studied such matters, but they have not succeeded in broadcasting their conclusions widely. Thus, it is still not widely known that American Indians have epics, that they performed plays long before Europeans arrived, and that they practiced politics and carried on tra de. One way to gain a fuller appreciation of this rich culture is to examine American Indian poetry, for poetry is in all cultures the most central and articulate of the arts. It is especially important that we study American Indian poetry as this poetry c an create a context that gives cohesive expression to the crafts, the artifacts, and the isolated facts that many Americans have managed to notice willy-nilly. Even a survey of American Indian poetry reveals a range of poetic thought and technique that defies easy generalization. Jarold Ramsey hazards a summary, however, which serves at least to give the uninitiated reader some sense of what American Indian poetr y is like. Overall, he writes, it represents an oral, formulaic, traditional, and anonymous art form,  whose approach is to emphasize the mythic and sacred  components of reality. It flourished through public performances... by skilled recitalists whose  audiences already knew the individual stories  and valued the performers for their ability to exploit their material dramatically and to combine them their stories  in longer cycles  rather than for their plot invention.  Because this poetry belongs to  highly ethnocentric tribal peoples, whose cultures we still do not know much about,  it is likely to seem all the more terse, even cryptic.  American Indian poetry has another feature that Ramsey ignores: it is always functional. Whether sung, chanted, or recited; whether performed ceremonially, as entertainment, or as part of a task such as curing a patient or grinding corn; or whether recited individually or by a group, it is always fully woven into the fabric of ordinary life.  For complicated reasons,  American Indian poetry has basically been ignored by non -Indian cultures. Kenneth Lincoln writes that failure to hear American Indian voices results partly...from the tragedies of tribal dislocation, partly from mistranslation, partly from misconceptions  about literature, partly from cultural indifference.  Brian Swann suggests an additional explanation: tribal poetry is oral, whereas Europeans arrived in the New World with a deeply ingrained belief in the  primacy of the written word. As a result, Europea n settles found it hard to imagine that poetry could exist without written texts and thus that the American Indians had achieved something parallel to what Europeans called literature long before Europeans arrived.

This central business district (CBD) is the source of so -called high -order goods and services, which can most efficiently be provided from a c entral location rather than from numerous widely dispersed locations. Thus, retailers of infrequently and irregularly purchased goods, such as fur coats, jewelry, and antique furniture, and specialized service outlets , such as th eaters, advertising agencies, law firms, and government agencies, will generally be found in the CBD. By contrast, less costly, more frequently demanded goods, such as groceries and housewares, and low-order services, such as shoe repair and hairdressing, will be available at many small, widely scattered outlets throughout the metropolis.  Both the concentric -ring model of the metropolis , first developed in Chicago in the late nineteenth century, and the sector model, closely associated with the work of Home r Hoyt in the 1930s, make the CBD the focal point  of the metropolis. The concentric -ring model assumes that the varying degrees of need for  accessibility to the CBD of various kinds of economic entities will be the main determinant of their location. Thus, wholesale and manufacturing firms, which need easy accessibility to the specialized  legal, financial, and governmental services provided in the CBD, will normally be located just outside  the CBD itself. Residential area s will occupy the outer rings of the model, with low -income groups residing in the relatively crowded older housing close to the business zone and high -income groups occupying the outermost ring, in the more spacious, newer residential areas built up throu gh urban expansion.  Homer Hoyt s sector model is a modified version of the concentric -ring model. Recognizing the influence of early established patterns of geographic distribution on the later growth of the city, Hoyt developed the concept of directional inertia.  According to Hoyt, custom and social pressures tend to perpetuate locational patterns within the city. Thus, if a particular part of the city (say, the east side) becomes a common residential area for higher -income families, perhaps 218 , ,      because of a p articular topographical advantage such as a lake or other desirable feature, future expansion of the high -income segment of the population is likely to proceed in the same direction. In our example, as the metropolis expands, a wedge -shaped sector would de velop on the east side of the city in which the higher -income residence would be clustered. Lower-income residences, along with manufacturing facilities, would be confined, therefore, to the western margins of the CBD.  Although Hoyt s model undoubtedly rep resented an advance in sophistication over the simpler concentric -ring model, neither model fully accounts  for the increasing importance of focal points other than the traditional CBD. Recent years have witnessed he establishment around older cities of sec ondary nuclei centered on suburban business districts. In other cases, particular kinds of goods, services, and manufacturing facilities have clustered in specialized centers away from the CBD, encouraging the development of particular housing patterns in the adjacent areas.

A recent study of important inventions made since the turn of the century reveals that more than half were the product of individual inventors working alone, independent of organized industrial research. While industrial laboratories contributed such import ant products as nylon and transistors, independent inventors developed air conditioning, the automatic transmission, the jet engine, the helicopter, insulin, and streptomycin. Still other inventions, such as stainless steel, television, silicones, and Plex iglas were developed through the combined efforts of individuals and laboratory teams.  Despite these finding, we are urged to support  monopolistic  power on the grounds that such power creates an environment supportive of  innovation. We are told that the independent inventor, along with the small firm, cannot afford to undertake the important research needed  to improve our standard  of living while protecting our diminishing resources; that only the giant corporation or con glomerate, with its prodigious assets, can afford the kind of expenditures that produce the technological advances vital to economic progress. But when we examine    221  expenditures for research , we find that of the more than $35 billion spent each year in this country, almost two -thirds is spent by the federal government. More than half of this government expenditure is funneled  into military research and product development, accounting for the enormous increase  in spending in such industries as nuclear energy, aircraft, missiles, and electronics. There are those who consider it questionable  that these defense -linked research projects will either improve our standard of living or do much to protect our diminishing resources.

While it can be assumed that in a highly competitive industry not dominated by single corporation, investment in innovation a risky and expensive budget item might  meet resistance from management and stockholders concerned about cost-cuttin g, efficient organization, and large advertising budgets, it would be an egregious error to equate the monopolistic producer with bountiful expenditures on research. Large-scale enterprises  tend to operate more comfortably in stable and secure circumstance s, and their managerial bureaucracies  tend to promote the status quo and resist the threat implicit in change. Moreover, in some cases, industrial giants faced with little or no competition seek to avoid the capital loss resulting from obsolescence by deli berately obstructing technological progress.

It may be unpleasant. A favorite Shavian metaphor for the function of the arts is that of tooth -pulling. Even if the patient is under laughing gas, the tooth is still pulled.  The history of aesthetics affords more examples of a didactic than of a hedonist view. But Shaw s didacticism takes an unusual turn in its application to the history of arts. If, as Shaw holds, ideas are a most important part of a work of art, and if, as he also holds , ideas go out of date, it follows that even the best works of art go out of date in some important respects  and that the generally held view that great works are in all respects eternal is not shared by Shaw. In the preface to Three P lays for Puritans , he maintains that renewal in the arts means renewal in philosophy, that the first great artist who comes along after a renewal gives to the new philosophy full and final form, that subsequent artists, though even more gifted, can do noth ing but refine upon the master without matching him. Shaw, whose essential modesty  is as disarming as his pose of vanity is disconcerting, assigns to himself the role, not of the master, but of the pioneer, the role of a Marlowe rather than of a Shakespear e. The whirligig of time will soon bring my audiences to my own point of view,  he writes, and then the next Shakespeare  that comes along will turn these petty tentative s of mine into masterpieces final for their epoch.  Final for their epoch even Shakespearean masterpieces are not final beyond that. No one, says Shaw, will ever write a better tragedy than Lear or a better opera than Don Giovanni  or a better music drama than Der Ring des Nibelungen;  but just as essential to a play as this aesthetic meri t is moral relevance which, if we take a naturalistic and historical view of morals, it loses, or partly loses, in time. Shaw, who has the courage of his historicism, consistently withstands the view that moral problems  do not change, and argues therefore that for us modern literature and music form a Bible surpassing in significance the Hebrew Bible.

Characterizing life situations in terms of ap proach and avoidance, this theory holds that persons tend to be drawn to pleasant situations and repelled by unpleasant ones. In the latter case, alcohol ingestion is said to reduce the tension or feelings of unpleasantness and to replace them with the fee ling of euphoria generally observed in most persons after they have consumed one or more drinks.  Some experimental evidence tends to show that alcohol reduces fear in the approach -avoidance situation. Conger trained one group of rats to approach a food goa l and, using aversion conditioning, trained another group to avoid electric shock. After an injection of alcohol the pull away from the shock was measurable weaker, while the pull toward the food was unchanged.  The obvious troubles experienced by alcoholic  persons appear to contradict the learning theory in the explanation of alcoholism. The discomfort, pain, and punishment they experience should presumably serve as a deterrent to drinking. The fact that alcoholic persons continue to drink in the face of fa mily discord, loss of employment, illness, and other sequels of repeated bouts is explained by the proximity of the drive reduction to the consumption of alcohol; that is, alcohol has the immediate effect  of reducing tension while the unpleasant  consequenc es of    227  drunken behavior come only later. The learning paradigm, therefore , favors the establishment and repetition of the resort to alcohol.  In fact, the anxieties and feelings of guilt induced by the consequences of excessive alcohol ingestion may themselv es become the signal for another bout of alcohol abuse. The way in which the cue for another bout could be the anxiety itself is explained  by the process of stimulus generalization: conditions or events occurring at the time of reinforcement tend to acquir e the characteristics of state of anxiety or fear, the emotional state itself takes on the properties of a stimulus, thus triggering another drinking bout.  The role of punishment is becoming increasingly important  in formulating a cause of alcoholism based  on the principles of learning theory. While punishment may serve to suppress a response, experiments have shown that in some cases it can serve as a reward and reinforce the behavior . Thus if the alcoholic person has learned to drink under conditions of b oth reward and punishment, either type of condition  may precipitate renewed drinking.  Ample experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that excessive alcohol consumption can be learned. By gradually increasing the concentration of alcohol in drinking wa ter, psychologists have been able to induce the ingestion of larger amounts of alcohol by an animal than would be normally consumed. Other researchers have been able to achieve similar results by varying the schedule of reinforcement that is, by requiring the animal to consume larger and larger amounts of the alcohol solutions before rewarding it. In this manner, animals learn to drink enough to become dependent on alcohol in terms of demonstrating withdrawal symptoms.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

Changes in the volume of unemployment  are governed by three fundamental forces: the growth of the labor force, t he increase  in output per man -hour, and the growth of total demand for goods and services. Changes in the average hours of work enter in exactly parallel fashion but have been quantitatively less significant. As productivity  rises, less labor is required p er dollar  of national product, or more goods and services can be produced with the same number of man -hours. If output does not grow, employment will certainly fall; if production increases more rapidly than productivity (less any decline in average hours worked), employment must rise. But the labor force grows, too. Unless gross national product (total final expenditure for goods and services corrected for price changes) rises more rapidly than the sum of productivity increase and labor force growth (again  modified for any change in hours of work), the increase 230 , ,      in employment will be inadequate to absorb the growth in the labor force. Inevitably the unemployment rate will increase. Only when total production expands faster than the rate of labor force growth  plus the rate of productivity increase and minus the rate at which average annual hours fall does the unemployment rate fall. Increases in productivity were more important than growth of the labor force as sources of the wide gains in output experienced i n the period from the end of World War II to the mid -sixties. These increases in potential production simply were not matched by increases in demand adequate to maintain steady full employment.  Except for the recession years of 1949, 1954, and 1958, the ra te of economic growth exceeded  the rate of productivity increase. However, in the late 1950s productivity and the labor force were increasing more rapidly than usual, while the growth  of output was slower than usual. This accounted for the change in employ ment rates.  But if part of the national purpose is to reduce and contain unemployment, arithmetic is not enough. We must know which of the basic factors we can control and which we wish to control. Unemployment  would have risen more slowly or fallen more r apidly if productivity had increased more slowly, or the labor force had increased more slowly, or the hours of work had fallen more steeply, or total output had grown more rapidly. These are not independent factors, however, and a change in any of them mi ght have caused changes in the  others.  A society can choose to reduce the growth of productivity, and it can probably find ways to frustrate its own creativity. However, while a reduction in the growth of productivity at the expense of potential output mig ht result in higher employment in the short run, the long -run effect on the national interest would be disastrous.  We must also give consideration to the fact that hidden beneath national  averages is continuous movement into, out of, between, and within la bor markets. For example, 15 years ago, the average number of persons in the labor force was 73.4 million, with about 66.7 million employed and 3.9 million unemployed. Yet 14 million experienced some term of unemployment in that year. Some were new entrant s to the labor force; others were laid off temporarily . The remainder were those who were permanently or indefinitely severed from their jobs. Thus, the average number unemployed during a year understates the actual volume  of involuntary  displacement that occurs.  High unemployment is not an inevitable result of the pace of technological change but the consequence of passive public policy. We can anticipate a moderate increase in the labor force accompanied  by a slow and irregular decline in hours of work. It follows that the output of the economy and the aggregate demand to buy it must grow by more than 4 percent a year just to prevent the unemployment rate from rising, and by even more if the unemployment rate is to fall further. Yet our economy has seldom,  if ever, grown at a rate greater than 3.5 percent for any extended length of time. We have no cause of complacency .

During Darwin s lifetime, the accepted theory of heredity was not Mendel s theory of particula te inheritance , which, though published, was unrecognized, but the theory of blending inheritance , which holds that forms intermediate between those of the parents result from mating. Jenkin pointed out that if a rare and favorable mutation occurred, it would soon be blended out by repeated crossings from the wild -type form. Disputing Darwin s conception of evolution as proceeding through the natural selection of those with slightly better characteristics that arose randomly, Jenkin concluded that nat ural selection  could not account for the tremendous diversity of life, hypothesizing that large numbers of organisms mutated  simultaneously  in the same direction a controlled orthogenetic process  resembling a series of special creations.  Since special creationism  was an ideological target of his, Darwin found himself in a quandary. Although he did not abandon his theory, he admitted that natural selection played  a much smaller part in evo lution than he had previously claimed. He also embraced the 236 , ,      Lamarckian concept that acquired traits in parents are transmitted to their offspring, thus providing a mechanism by which an entire population  could change in the same direction at once.  Another potent objection came from the physicists led by Lord Kelvin, who contested the assumption of previous geologists and biologists that life had existed for billions of years, if not infinitely. How, they asked, could evolution proceed by slow steps in milli ons of years, and how could advanced  forms recently evolved show such great differences ? The Kelvinists, basing their conclusion on the assumption that the sun was an incandescent liquid mass rapidly radiating heat, calculated that the age of the earth was  between 20 and 40 million years.  Admitting  that their calculations were correct and their premises rational, Darwin was forced to adjust this theory. He proposed that change had occurred much more rapidly in the past than in the present, where species see med static, and that more advanced forms varied more rapidly than lower forms. This provided further reason to advocate Lamarck s theory of inheritance, because that could account for the rapid change.  Interestingly, both these retreats of Darwin were late r shown to be faulty. The discovery that the sun runs on a nearly infinite amount of atomic fuel totally invalidated Kelvin s argument, Mendel was rediscovered  in the twentieth century, when it was pointed out that the particulate nature of inheritance m eant that favorable mutation not only could persist, but could rapidly become prevalent.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

There is no universally accepted standard for obesity, defined generally as an excess of adipose tissue , but a common rule of thumb classifies people who are more than 20 percent above their desirable weight as obese. By this measure, 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women in America are obese. Although studies show that few of these  people will e ver recover fully and permanently from the disease, the incidence of obesity in future generations can be reduced.  Adipose tissue is a triumph of evolution. Fat yields 9 calories per gram, while protein, like carbohydrates, yields only 4 calories per gram.  Fat also contains much less water than protein  does. Therefore, fat is much more efficient for storing excess energy than is protein. Primitive humans, with uncertain food sources, had a great need for excess fat, and their bodies adapted accordingly. Modern humans, with a predictable food supply and a sedentary life -style, are burdened by this vestige of evolution. Although they need some adipose tissue to provide insulation and protect internal organs from injury, modern humans need much less than their    239  primitive ancestors did.  In an attempt to shed excess adipose tissue, many Americans turn from one fad diet to another, and a billion -dollar diet industry has grown up to aid them in their efforts. Nevertheless, the five -year cure rate for obesity is very low. In fact, by comparison, cancer is more curable. The reasons for this are psychological as well as physiological.  From a physical  standpoint , losing a pound or two a week for a few weeks is not difficult because most of the loss is in the form of  protein and water, and protein carries four times its weight in water. However, protein is also the only source of nitrogen in the body, and when the body loses too much nitrogen, it acts to correct the imbalance  by excreting less nitrogen than it  takes in. Hence beyond a certain point additional weight loss must come from adipose tissue, which, because of its compactness, takes longer to shed. The body s tendency to return  to nitrogen balance and to protect its energy reserves can be so strong tha t dieters may stop losing or even gain weight while still expending more calories than they ingest. As a result, they frequently suffer not only from hunger, weakness, and a decreased metabolic rate, but also from depression and inactivity, all of which le ad them to abandon their diets. Probably because of numerous psychological factors as well as physiological factors such as increased lipid synthesis, they then tend to regain weight rapidly.  While vigorous attempts to reduce obesity in America should be a imed at all affected, the most successful efforts are likely to be those directed toward children. If the advertising and food industries stop trying to sell high -calorie , nutritional ly deficient food to children, and if parents understand that the feeding  patterns they impose on their children can determine the adolescent and adult eating habits those children will develop, the future generation may not be as fat as ours is.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

For the view of matter that the Impressionists assumed differed profoundly from the view that had previously prevailed among artists. This view helped to unify the artistic works created in the new st yle. The ancient Greeks had conceived of the world in concrete terms, even endowing abstract qualities with bodies. This Greek view of matter persisted, so far as painting was concerned, into the nineteenth century. The Impressionists , on the other hand, v iewed light, not matter, as the ultimate  visual reality. The philosopher Taine expressed the Impressionist view of things 242 , ,      when he said, The chief person  in a picture is the light in which everything is bathed.  In Impressionist painting, solid bodies be came mere reflectors of light, and distinctions between one object and another became arbitrary conventions; for by light all things were welded together . The treatment of both color and outline was transformed as well. Color, formerly considered a propert y inherent in an object, was seen to be merely the result of vibrations of light on the object s colorless surface . And outline, whose function had formerly been to indicate the limits of objects, now marked instead merely the boundary between units of pat tern, which often merged into one another.  The Impressionist world was composed not of separate objects but of many surfaces on which light struck and was reflected with varying intensity to the eye through the atmosphere, which modified it. It was this pr ocess that produced the mosaic of colors that formed an Impressionist canvas. Light becomes the sole subject of the picture,  writes Mauclair. The interest of the object upon which it plays is secondary. Painting thus conceived becomes a purely optic art . From this profoundly revolutionary  form of art, then, all ideas religious, moral, psychological were excluded, and so were all emotions except certain aesthetic ones.

These natural sources account for an exposure of about 100 millirems a year for the average American.  The largest single source of man -made radiation is medical X rays, yet most scientists  agree that hazards from this source are not as great as those from weapons test fallout, since strontium  90 and carbon 14 become incorporated into the body, hence delivering radiation for an entire lifeti me. The issue is, however, by no means uncontroversial. The last two decades have witnessed intensified examination and dispute about the effects of low -level radiation, beginning with the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiat ion, which reported in 1958 that even the smallest amounts of radiation are likely to cause deleterious genetic and perhaps also somatic effects . A survey conducted in Britain confirmed that an abnormally  high percentage of patients suffering from arthritis of the spine who had been treated  with X rays contracted cancer. Another study  revealed a high incidence of childhood cancer in cases where the mother had been given prenatal pelvic X rays. These studies have pointed to the need to reexamine the assumption that exposure to low -linear energy transfer  presents only a minor  risk. Recently, examinat ion of the death certificates of former employees of a West Coast plant that produces plutonium for nuclear weapons revealed markedly higher rates for cancers of the pancreas, lung, bone marrow , and lymphatic system  than would have been expected in a normal population.  While the National Academy of Sciences committee attributes  this difference to chemical or other environmental causes  rather than radiation , other scientists maintain that any radiation exposure , no matter how small, leads to an increase in cancer risk. It is believed by some that a dose of one rem, if sustained over many generations, would lead to an increase  of 1 percent in the number of serious genetic defects  at birth,  a possible increase of 1,000 disorders per million births.

Yet any close reading of Johnson s critic ism shows that Johnson is not blind to the importance of the immediate, vivid, specific detail in literature; rather, he would underscore the need for the telling  rather than the merely accidental  detail.  In other ways, too, Johnson s critical method had m uch in common with  that of the Romantics, with whom Johnson and, indeed, the entire neoclassical tradition are generally supposed to be in conflict. Johnson was well aware, for example, of the sterility of literary criticism that is l egalistic or pedantic, as was the case with the worst products of the neoclassical school. His famous argument against the slavish following of the three unities  of classical drama is a good example, as is his defense of the supposedly illegitimate tragicomic  mode of Shakespeare s latest plays. Note, in particular, the basis of that defense: That this is a practice contrary to the rules of criticism,  Johnson wrote, will be readily allowed; but there is always an appeal from criticism to nature.  The sentiment thus expressed could easily be endorsed by any of the Romantics; the empiricism it exemplifies is vital quality of Johnson s criticism, as is the willingness to jettison laws of criticism when to do so makes possible  a more direct appeal to the  emotions of the reader. Addison s Cato, highly praised in Johnson s day for its correctness,  is damned with faint praise by Johnson: Cato affords a splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners, and delivers just and noble sentiments, in dic tion easy, elevated, and harmonious, but its hopes and fears communicate no vibration to the heart.  Wordsworth could hardly demur.  Even on the question of poetic diction, which, according to the usual interpretation of Wordsworth s 1800 preface to the Lyrical Ballads , was the central area of conflict between Romantic and Augustan, Johnson s views are surprisingly modern.  In his Life of Dryden , he defends the use of a special diction in poetry, it is true; but his reasons are all -important. For Johnson, p oetic diction should serve the ends of direct emotional impact and ease of comprehension, not those of false profundity or grandiosity. Words too familiar,  he wrote, or too remote, defeat the purpose of a poet. From those sounds which we hear on small o r on coarse occasions, we do not easily receive strong impressions, or delightful images; and words to which we are nearly strangers, whenever they occur, draw that attention on themselves which they should transmit to things.  If the poetic diction of the  neoclassical poets, at its worst, erects needless barriers between reader and meaning, that envisioned by Johnson would do just the opposite : it would put the reader in closer contact with the things  that are the poem s subject.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "1.

While not all adherents to this philosophy would totally eliminate the study of great books, the gradual subordination of literature in the school curriculum  reflects th eir influence.  What is the purpose of literature? Why read if life alone is to be our teacher? James Joyce tells us that the artist reveals the human condition by re -creating life out of life; Aristotle, that art presents universal truths because its form is taken from nature.

How much wider is the understanding w e gain from reading than from viewing life through the keyhole of our individual experience . This function of literature, the enlarging of our life sphere, is of major importance in itself. Additionally, however, literature suggests solutions to social pro blems.

The problems and behavior of the guilt-ridden did not await the appearance of the bea rded psychoanalysts of the nineteenth century.

We must start with the field of agreement: the belief that education should serve to improve the individual and society.

Only in the last de cade or two, however, have scientists begun to believe that genetic markers in blood and other bodily fluids may someday prove as useful in crime detection as fingerprints.  The standard ABO blood typing has long been used as a form of negative identificati on. Added sophistication came with the discovery of additional  subgroups of genetic markers in blood and with the discovery that genetic markers are present not only in blood but also in other bodily fluids, such as perspiration and saliva.  These discoveri es were of little use in crime detection, however, because of the circumstances in which police scientists must work. Rather than a plentiful sample of blood freshly drawn from a patient, the crime laboratory is likely to receive only a tiny fleck of dried  blood of unknown age from an unknown donor  on a shirt or a scrap of rag that has spent hours or days exposed to air, high temperature, and other contaminants.     255  British scientists found a method for identifying genetic markers more precisely in small samp les. In this process, called electrophoresis, a sample is placed on a tray containing a gel through which an electrical current is then passed. A trained analyst reads the resulting patterns in the gel to determine the presence of various chemical markers.  Electrophoresis made it possible to identify several  thousand subgroups of blood types rather than the twelve known before. However, the equipment and special training required were expensive. In addition, the process could lead to the destruction of evid ence. For example, repeated tests of a blood -flecked shirt one for each marker led to increasing deterioration of the evidence and the cost of a week or more of laboratory time.  It remained for another British researcher, Brian Wrexall, to demonstrate that  simultaneous analyses, using an inexpensive electrophoresis apparatus , could test for ten different genetic markers within a 24 -hour period.

Under these circumstances , the convention was understandably reluctant to submi t its work to the Congress for approval.  Instead, the delegates decided to pursue what amounted to a revolutionary course.

In other words, the Constitution was being submitted directly to the people. Not even the Congress, which had called the convention, would be asked to approve its work.

A book by Anne Summers seeks to debunk the idealizations and present a reality at odds with Nightingales heroic reputation.

Additionally, Summers writes that the contribution of the nurses to the relief of the wounded was at best marginal. The prevailing problems of military medicine were caused by army organizational practices, and the addition of a few nurses to the medical staff could be no more than symbolic. Nightingales place in the national pantheon, Summers asserts, is largely due t o the propagandistic efforts of contemporary newspaper reporters.  By contrast, the editors of a new volume of Nightingales letters view Nightingale as a person who significantly influenced not only her own age but also subsequent generations. They highlig ht her ongoing efforts to reform sanitary conditions after the war. For example, when she learned that peacetime living conditions in British barracks were so horrible that the death rate of enlisted men far exceeded that of neighboring civilian population s, she succeeded in persuading the government to establish a Royal Commission on the Health of the Army. She used sums raised through public contributions to found a nurses training hospital in London. Even in administrative matters, the editors assert, h er practical intelligence  was formidable: as recently as 1947 the British Armys medical services were still using the cost -accounting system she had devised in the 1860s.  I believe that the evidence of her letters supports continued respect for Nightingales brilliance and creativity.

Astronomers have hypothesized that a meteor stream sh ould broaden with time as the dust particles individual orbits are perturbed by planetary gravitational fields. A recent computer -modeling experiment tested this hypothesis by tracking the influence of planetary gravitation over a projected 5,000 -year per iod on the positions of a group of hypothetical dust particles. In the model, the particles were randomly distributed throughout a computer simulation  of the orbit of an actual meteor stream, the Geminid. The researcher found, as expected, that the computer -model stream broadened with time. Conventional theories, however, predicted that the distribution of particles would be increasingly dense tow ard the center of a meteor stream. Surpri singly, the computer -model meteor stream gradually came to resemble a thick -walled, hollow pipe.  Whenever the Earth passes through a meteor stream, a meteor shower  occurs. Moving at a little over 1,500,000 miles per day around its orbit, the Earth would take, on average, just over a day to cross the hollow, computer -model Geminid stream if the stream were 5,000 years old. Two brief periods of peak meteor activity during the shower would be o bserved, one as the Earth entered the thick -walled pipe and one as it exited.

The Milky Way contains about 125 globular clusters (compact groups of anywhere from several tens of thousands  to perhaps a million stars) distributed in a roughly spherical halo ar ound the galactic nucleus . The stars in these clusters are believed to have been born during the formation of the galaxy, and so may be considered relics of the original galactic nebula , holding vital  clues to the way the formation took place.  The conventional theory of the formation of the galaxy contends that roughly 12 to 13 billion years ago the Milky Way formed over a relatively short time (about 200 million years) when a spherical cloud of gas co llapsed under the pressure of its own gravity into a disc surrounded by a halo. Such a rapid formation of the galaxy would mean that all stars in the halo should be very nearly the same age.  However, the astronomer Michael Bolte has found considerable vari ation in the ages of globular clusters. One of the clusters studied by Bolte is 2 billions years older than most other clusters in the galaxy, while another is 2 billion years younger. A colleague of Bolte contends that the cluster called Palomar 12 is 5 b illion years younger than most other globular clusters.     267  To explain the age differences among the globular clusters, astronomers are taking a second look at renegade theories. One such newly fashionable theory, first put forward by Richard Larson in the e arly 1970s, argues that the halo of the Milky Way formed over a period of a billion or more years as hundreds of small gas clouds drifted about, collided, lost orbital energy, and finally collapsed into a centrally condensed elliptical system.

The large volume of transactions associated with these activities seems to have necessitated hierarchical management structures well before the advent of modern communications and transportation.

In thus maintaining that wage -work helped to produce a new consciousness among women, Eisenstein to some extent  challenges the    277  recent, contro versial proposal by Leslie Tentler that for women the work experience  only served to reinforce the attractiveness of the dominant ideology. According to the Tentler, the degrading conditions under which many female wage earners w orked made them view the family as a source of power and esteem available nowhere else in their social world. In contrast, Eisensteins study insists that wage -work had other implications for womens identities and consciousness. Most importantly, her work  aims to demonstrate that wage -work enabled women to become aware of themselves as a distinct social group capable of defining their collective circumstance. Eisenstein insists that as a group working -class women were not able to come to collective conscio usness of their situation until they began entering the labor force, because domestic work tended to isolate them from one another.  Unfortunately, Eisensteins unfinished study does not develop these ideas in sufficient depth or detail, offering tantalizin g hints rather than an exhaustive analysis. Whatever Eisensteins overall plan may have been, in its current form her study suffers from the limited nature of the sources she depended on. She uses the speeches and writings of reformers and labor organizers , who she acknowledges were far from representative, as the voice of the typical woman worker. And there is less than adequate attention given to the differing values of immigrant groups that made up a significant proportion of the population under investi gation. While raising important questions, Eisensteins essays do not provide definitive answer, and it remains for others to take up the challenges they offer.", "Question": [{"item": {"text": "249.

The earliest research on mangrove forests produced descriptions of species distribution from shore to land, without exploring the causes of the distributions.  The idea that zonation is caused by plant succession  was first expressed by J. H. Davis in a study of Florida mangrove forests. According to Davis scheme, the shoreline is being extended in a seaward direction because of the land -building role of mangroves, which, by trapping sediments over ti me, extend the shore. As a habitat gradually becomes more inland as the shore extends, the land -building species are replaced. This continuous process of accretion and succession would be interrupted only by hurricanes or storm flushings.  Recently the un iversal application of Davis succession paradigm has been challenged. It appears that in areas where weak currents and weak tidal energies allow the accumulation of sediments, mangroves will follow land formation and accelerate the rate of soil accretion;  succession will proceed according to Davis scheme. But on stable coastlines, the distribution of mangrove species results in other patterns of zonation; land building does not occur.  To find a principle that explains the various distribution patterns, several researchers have looked to salinity and its effects on mangrove. While mangroves can develop in fresh water, they can also thrive in salinities as high as 2.5 times that of seawater. However, those mangrove species found in freshwater habitats do w ell only in the absence of competition, thus suggesting that salinity tolerance is a critical factor in competitive success among mangrove species. Research suggests that mangroves will normally dominate highly saline regions,    279  although not because they req uire salt. Rather, they are metabolically efficient (and hence grow well) in portions of an environment whose high salinity excludes plants adapted to lower salinities. Tides create different degrees of salinity along a coastline.

Backward integration removes the need for some purchasing and marketing functions,  centralizes overhead, and permits manufacturers to eliminate duplicated efforts in research and development.  Where components are commodities (ferrous metals or petroleum, for example), backward integration almost certainly boosts profits. Nevertheless, b ecause product innovation means adopting the most technologically advanced and cost -effective ways of making components, backward integration may entail a serious risk for a technologically active company for example, a producer of sophisticated consumer e lectronics.

Independent suppliers may be unwilling to share innovations with assemblers with whom they are competing. Moreover, when an assembler se ts out to master the technology of producing advanced components, the resulting demands on its resources may compromise its ability to assemble these components successfully into end products.

The desert rat and the camel in the most water -deprived environments, and marine vertebrates in an all-water environment, encounter the same regulatory problem: maintaining adequate internal fluid balance.  For desert rats and camels, the problem is conservation of water in an environment where standing water is nonexistent, temperature is high, and humidity is low. Despite these handicaps, desert rats are able to maintain the osmotic pressure o f their blood, as well as their total bo dy-water content, at approximately the same levels as other rats. One countermeasure is behavioral: these rats stay in burrows during the hot part of the day, thus avoiding loss of 282 , ,      fluid through panting or sweating, which are regulatory mechanisms for maintaining internal body temperature by evaporative cooling . Also, desert rats kidneys can excrete a urine having twice as high a salt content as sea water.  Camels, on the other hand, rely more on simple endurance.

Marine vertebrates experience difficulty with their water balance because though there is no shortage  of seawater to drink, they must drink a lot of it to maintain their internal fluid balance.

It is now possible to hear a recording of Carusos singing that is fa r superior to any made during his lifetime. A decades -old wa x-cylinder recording of this great operatic tenor has been digitized, and the digitized signal has been processed by computer to remove the extraneous sound, or noise, introduced by the now anc ient wax -cylinder recording process.  Although this digital technique needs improvements, it represents a new and superior way of recording and processing sound which overcomes many of the limitations of analog recording. In analog recording systems, the o riginal sound is represented as a continuous waveform created by variations in the sounds amplitude over time. When analog playback systems reproduce this waveform, however, they invariably introduce distortions. First, the waveform produced during playba ck differs somewhat from the original waveform. Second, the medium that stores the analog recording creates noise during playback which gets added to the recorded sounds.  Digital recordings, by contrast, reduce the original sound to a series of discrete nu mbers that represent the sounds waveform. Because the digital playback system reads only numbers, any noise and distortion that may accumulate during storage and manipulation of the digitized signal will have little effect: as long as the numbers remain  recognizable, the original waveform will be reconstructed with little loss in quality. However, because the waveform is continuous, while its digital representation is composed of discrete numbers, it is impossible for digital systems to avoid some distor tion. One kind of distortion, called sampling error, occurs if the sound is sample d (i.e., its amplitude is measured) too infrequently, so that the amplitude changes more than one quantum (the smallest change in amplitude measured by the digital system) between samplings. In effect, the sound is changing too quickly for the system to record it accurately. A second form of distortion is quantizing error, which arises when the amplitude being measured is not a whole number of quanta, forcing the digital r ecorder to round off.
