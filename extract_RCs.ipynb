      "communities, however, must be many times the ordinary fallout. The first reports describing \n",
      "vent faunas proposed two possible sources of nutrition: bacterial che mosynthesis, production \n",
      "of food by bacteria using energy derived from chemical changes, and advection, the drifting of \n",
      "food materials from surrounding regions. Later, evidence in support of the idea of intense local \n",
      "chemosynthesis was accumulated: hydrogen  sulfide was found in vent water; many vent -site \n",
      "bacteria were found to be capable of chemosynthesis; and extremely large concentrations of \n",
      "bacteria were found in samples of vent water thought to be pure. This final observation seemed \n",
      "decisive. If such ast onishing concentrations of bacteria were typical of vent outflow, then food \n",
      "within the vent would dwarf any contribution from advection. Hence, the widely quoted \n",
      "conclusion was reached that bacterial chemosynthesis provides the foundation for \n",
      "hydrothermal -vent food chains —an exciting prospect because no other communities on Earth \n",
      "are independent of photosynthesis.  \n",

      "ancestral remains.  \n",
      "(D) In cases in which Native Americans can establish standing, common law can \n",
      "be useful in protecting ancestral remains and the artifacts buried with them.  \n",
      "(E) Native Americans are unlikely to make significant progre ss in the recovery of \n",

      "When the same habitat types (forests, oceans, grasslands etc.) in regions of different \n",
      "latitudes are compared, it becomes apparent that the overall number of species increases from \n",
      "pole to equator. This latitudinal gradient is probably even more pronounced than current \n",
      "records indicate, since researchers believe that most undiscovered species l ive in the tropics . \n",
      "One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, the “time theory” holds that diverse species \n",
      "adapted to today’s climatic conditions have had more time to emerge in the tropical regions, \n",
      "which, unlike the temperate and arctic zones, have been  unaffected by a succession of  ice ages. \n",
      "However, ice ages have caused less disruption in some temperate regions than in others and \n",
      "have not interrupted arctic conditions.  \n",
      "Alternatively, the species -energy hypothesis proposes the fol lowing positive correlations: \n",
      "incoming energy from the Sun correlated with rates of growth and reproduction; rates of \n",
      "growth and reproduction with the amount of living matter ( biomass ) at a given moment; and \n",
      "the amount of bioma ss with number of species. However, since organisms may die rapidly, high \n",
      "production rates can exist with low biomass. And high biomass can exist with few species. \n",
      "Moreover, the mechanism proposed —greater energy influx leading to bigger populations, \n",

      "A third hypothesis centers on the tropics’ climatic stability, which provides a more reliable \n",

      "species can tolerate gr eater overlap between their respective niches. Both capabilities enable \n",
      "more species to exist on the same resources. However, the ecology of local communities \n",
      "cannot account for the origin of the latitudinal gradient. Localized ecological pr ocesses such as \n",
      "competition do not generate regional pools of species, and it is the total number of species \n",

      " A fourth and most plausible hypothesis focuses on regional speciation, and in particular on \n",

      "The mechanism for this rate -of-speciation hypothesis is that most new animal species, and \n",

      "evolves differently and eventually cannot interbreed with members of the original population. \n",
      "The uneven spread of a species over a large geographic area promotes this mechanism: at the \n",

      "as a means to determine a site’s occupation span, Lowe assumes that once new monuments \n",
      "ceased to be built, a site had been abandoned. Lowe’s a nalysis of the evidence suggests that \n",
      "construction of new monuments continued to increase between A.  D. 672 and 751 , but that the \n",
      "civilization stopped expanding geographically ; new construction took place almost exclusively \n",
      "in established settlements. The first signs of trouble followed. Monument inscriptions indicate \n",
      "that between 751 and 790, long -standing alliances started to break down. Evidence also \n",

      "hundred years, the Classic Mayan civilization all but  vanished.  \n",
      "Having established this chronology, Lowe sets forth  a plausible explanation of the collapse \n",
      "that accommodates  the available archaeological evidence. He theorizes that Classic Mayan \n",

      "growth. An increase in population, particularly within the elite segment of society, necessitated \n",

      "decline in productivity (the amount of food produced through each unit of labor invested). At \n",
      "the same time, the growth of the elite class created increasing demands for ceremonial \n",
      "monuments and luxuries, diverting needed labor from the fields. The theory holds that these \n",
      "stresses were communicated —and amplified —throughout the area as Mayan states engaged in \n",
      "warfare to acquire laborers and food, and refugees fled impoverished areas. The most \n",
