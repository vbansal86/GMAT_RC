"(This passage was written in 1978.)  
Recent years have brought minority -owned businesses in the United States unprecedented 
opportunities as well as new and significant risks. Civil rights acti vists have long argued that 
one of the principal reasons why Blacks, Hispanics, and other minority groups have difficulty 
establishing themselves in business is that they lack access to the sizable orders and 
subcontracts that are generated by large compan ies. Now Congress, in apparent agreement, 
has required by law that businesses awarded federal contracts of more than $500,000 do their 
best to find minority subcontractors and record their efforts to do so on forms filed with the 
government. Indeed, some f ederal and local agencies have gone so far as to set specific 
percentage goals for apportioning parts of public works contracts to minority enterprises.  
Corporate response appears to have been substantial. According to figures collected in 
1977, the total of corporate contracts with minority businesses rose from $77 million in 1972 to 
$1.1 billion in 1977. The projected total of corporate contracts with minority businesses for the 
early 1980s is estimated to be over 53 billion per year with no letup antici pated in the next 
decade. Promising as it is for minority businesses, this increased patronage poses dangers for 
them, too. First, minority firms risk expanding too fast and overextending themselves financially, 
since most are small concerns and, unlike la rge businesses, they often need to make 
substantial investments in new plants, staff, equipment, and the like in order to perform work 
subcontracted to them. If, thereafter, their subcontracts are for some reason reduced, such 
firms can face potentially cr ippling fixed expenses. The world of corporate purchasing can be 
frustrating for small entrepreneurs who get requests for elaborate formal estimates and bids. 
Both consume valuable time and resources, and a small companys efforts must soon result in 
order s, or both the morale and the financial health of the business will suffer.  
A second risk is that White -owned companies may seek to cash in on the increasing 
apportionments through formation of joint ventures with minority -owned concerns. Of course, 
in man y instances there are legitimate reasons for joint ventures; clearly, White and minority 
enterprises can team up  to acquire business that neither could acquire alone. But civil rights 
groups and minority business owners have co mplained to Congress about minorities being set 
up as  fronts  with White backing, rather than being accepted as full partners in legitimate  joint 
ventures.  
Third, a minority enterprise that secures the business of one large corporate customer 
often runs the danger of becoming and remaining dependent. Even in the best of 
circumstances, fierce competition from larger, more established companies  makes it difficult for 
small concerns to broaden their customer bases: when such firms have nearly guaranteed 
orders from a single corporate benefactor, they may truly have to struggle against complacency 
arising from their current success.  2 GMAT, GRE, LSAT","The projected total of corporate contracts with minority businesses for the

"(This passage was written in 1978.)  
Recent years have brought minority -owned businesses in the United States unprecedented 
opportunities as well as new and significant risks. Civil rights acti vists have long argued that 
one of the principal reasons why Blacks, Hispanics, and other minority groups have difficulty 
establishing themselves in business is that they lack access to the sizable orders and 
subcontracts that are generated by large compan ies. Now Congress, in apparent agreement, 
has required by law that businesses awarded federal contracts of more than $500,000 do their 
best to find minority subcontractors and record their efforts to do so on forms filed with the 
government. Indeed, some f ederal and local agencies have gone so far as to set specific 
percentage goals for apportioning parts of public works contracts to minority enterprises.

"A meteor stream  is composed of dust particles that have been ejected from a parent comet 
at a variety of velocities. These particles follow the same orbit as the parent comet, but due to 262 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 their differing velocities they slowly gain on  or fall behind the disintegrating comet until a 
shroud of dust surrounds the entire cometary orbit.  Astronomers have hypothesized that a 
meteor stream sh ould broaden with time as the dust particles individual orbits are perturbed by 
planetary gravitational fields. A recent computer -modeling experiment tested this hypothesis by 
tracking the influence of planetary gravitation over a projected 5,000 -year per iod on the 
positions of a group of hypothetical dust particles. In the model, the particles were randomly 
distributed throughout a computer simulation  of the orbit of an actual meteor stream, the 
Geminid. The researcher found, as expected, that the computer -model stream broadened with 
time. Conventional theories, however, predicted that the distribution of particles would be 
increasingly dense tow ard the center of a meteor stream. Surpri singly, the computer -model 
meteor stream gradually came to resemble a thick -walled, hollow pipe.  
Whenever the Earth passes through a meteor stream, a meteor shower  occurs. Moving at 
a little over 1,500,000 miles per day around its orbit, the Earth would take, on average, just 
over a day to cross the hollow, computer -model Geminid stream if the stream were 5,000 years 
old. Two brief periods of peak meteor activity during the shower would be o bserved, one as the 
Earth entered the thick -walled pipe and one as it exited.  There is no reason why the Earth 
should always pass through the streams exact center, so the time interval between the two 
bursts of activity would vary from one year to the n ext. 
Has the predicted twin -peaked activity been observed for the actual yearly Geminid meteor 
shower? The Geminid data between 1970 and 1979 show just such a bifurcation, a secondary 
burst of meteor activity being clearly visible at an average of 19 hours  (1,200,000 miles) after 
the first burst. The time intervals between the bursts suggest the actual Geminid stream is 
about 3,000 years old.

"A meteor stream  is composed of dust particles that have been ejected from a parent comet 
at a variety of velocities. These particles follow the same orbit as the parent comet, but due to 262 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 their differing velocities they slowly gain on  or fall behind the disintegrating comet until a 
shroud of dust surrounds the entire cometary orbit.  Astronomers have hypothesized that a 
meteor stream sh ould broaden with time as the dust particles individual orbits are perturbed by 
planetary gravitational fields. A recent computer -modeling experiment tested this hypothesis by 
tracking the influence of planetary gravitation over a projected 5,000 -year per iod on the 
positions of a group of hypothetical dust particles. In the model, the particles were randomly 
distributed throughout a computer simulation  of the orbit of an actual meteor stream, the 
Geminid. The researcher found, as expected, that the computer -model stream broadened with 
time. Conventional theories, however, predicted that the distribution of particles would be 
increasingly dense tow ard the center of a meteor stream. Surpri singly, the computer -model 
meteor stream gradually came to resemble a thick -walled, hollow pipe.  
Whenever the Earth passes through a meteor stream, a meteor shower  occurs. Moving at 
a little over 1,500,000 miles per day around its orbit, the Earth would take, on average, just 
over a day to cross the hollow, computer -model Geminid stream if the stream were 5,000 years 
old. Two brief periods of peak meteor activity during the shower would be o bserved, one as the 
Earth entered the thick -walled pipe and one as it exited.  There is no reason why the Earth 
should always pass through the streams exact center, so the time interval between the two 
bursts of activity would vary from one year to the n ext. 
Has the predicted twin -peaked activity been observed for the actual yearly Geminid meteor 
shower? The Geminid data between 1970 and 1979 show just such a bifurcation, a secondary 
burst of meteor activity being clearly visible at an average of 19 hours  (1,200,000 miles) after 
the first burst. The time intervals between the bursts suggest the actual Geminid stream is 
about 3,000 years old.

"New observations about the age of some globular clusters in our Milky Way galaxy  have 
cast doubt on a  long-held theory about how the galaxy was formed. The Milky Way contains 
about 125 globular clusters (compact groups of anywhere from several tens of thousands  to 
perhaps a million stars) distributed in a roughly spherical halo ar ound the galactic nucleus . The 
stars in these clusters are believed to have been born during the formation of the galaxy, and so 
may be considered relics of the original galactic nebula , holding vital  clues to the way the 
formation took place.  
The conventional theory of the formation of the galaxy contends that roughly 12 to 13 
billion years ago the Milky Way formed over a relatively short time (about 200 million years) 
when a spherical cloud of gas co llapsed under the pressure of its own gravity into a disc 
surrounded by a halo. Such a rapid formation of the galaxy would mean that all stars in the halo 
should be very nearly the same age.  
However, the astronomer Michael Bolte has found considerable vari ation in the ages of 
globular clusters. One of the clusters studied by Bolte is 2 billions years older than most other 
clusters in the galaxy, while another is 2 billion years younger. A colleague of Bolte contends 
that the cluster called Palomar 12 is 5 b illion years younger than most other globular clusters.   GMAT  267 
 To explain the age differences among the globular clusters, astronomers are taking a 
second look at renegade theories. One such newly fashionable theory, first put forward by 
Richard Larson in the e arly 1970s, argues that the halo of the Milky Way formed over a period 
of a billion or more years as hundreds of small gas clouds drifted about, collided, lost orbital 
energy, and finally collapsed into a centrally condensed elliptical system. Larsons co nception of

described in the passage?","{'Choice 0': 'The globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy are 2 billion years older than \npredicted by the conventional theory.', 'Choice 1': 'The ages of at least some globular clusters in the  Milky Way galaxy differ by \nat least 4 billion years.', 'Choice 2': 'One of the globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy is 5 billion years \nyounger than most others.', 'Choice 3': 'The globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy are significantly older than the \nindividual stars in the halo.', 'Choice 4': 'Most globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy are between 11 and 15 billion \nyears old.'}"
"New observations about the age of some globular clusters in our Milky Way galaxy  have 
cast doubt on a  long-held theory about how the galaxy was formed. The Milky Way contains 
about 125 globular clusters (compact groups of anywhere from several tens of thousands  to 
perhaps a million stars) distributed in a roughly spherical halo ar ound the galactic nucleus . The 
stars in these clusters are believed to have been born during the formation of the galaxy, and so 
may be considered relics of the original galactic nebula , holding vital  clues to the way the 
formation took place.  
The conventional theory of the formation of the galaxy contends that roughly 12 to 13 
billion years ago the Milky Way formed over a relatively short time (about 200 million years) 
when a spherical cloud of gas co llapsed under the pressure of its own gravity into a disc 
surrounded by a halo. Such a rapid formation of the galaxy would mean that all stars in the halo 
should be very nearly the same age.  
However, the astronomer Michael Bolte has found considerable vari ation in the ages of 
globular clusters. One of the clusters studied by Bolte is 2 billions years older than most other 
clusters in the galaxy, while another is 2 billion years younger. A colleague of Bolte contends 
that the cluster called Palomar 12 is 5 b illion years younger than most other globular clusters.   GMAT  267

"In an unfinished but highly suggestive series of essays, the late Sarah Eisenstein has 
focused attention on the evolution of working womens values from the turn of the  century to 
the First World War. Eisenstein argues that turn -of-the-century women neither wholly accepted 
nor rejected what she calls the dominant ideology of domesticity, but rather took this and 
other available ideologies feminism, socialism, trade uni onism and modified or adapted them 
in light of their own experiences and needs. In thus maintaining that wage -work helped to 
produce a new consciousness among women, Eisenstein to some extent  challenges the  GMAT  277 
 recent, contro versial proposal by Leslie Tentler that for women the work experience  only served 
to reinforce the attractiveness of the dominant ideology. According to the Tentler, the degrading 
conditions under which many female wage earners w orked made them view the family as a 
source of power and esteem available nowhere else in their social world. In contrast, 
Eisensteins study insists that wage -work had other implications for womens identities and 
consciousness. Most importantly, her work  aims to demonstrate that wage -work enabled 
women to become aware of themselves as a distinct social group capable of defining their 
collective circumstance. Eisenstein insists that as a group working -class women were not able 
to come to collective conscio usness of their situation until they began entering the labor force, 
because domestic work tended to isolate them from one another.  
Unfortunately, Eisensteins unfinished study does not develop these ideas in sufficient 
depth or detail, offering tantalizin g hints rather than an exhaustive analysis. Whatever 
Eisensteins overall plan may have been, in its current form her study suffers from the limited 
nature of the sources she depended on. She uses the speeches and writings of reformers and 
labor organizers , who she acknowledges were far from representative, as the voice of the 
typical woman worker. And there is less than adequate attention given to the differing values of 
immigrant groups that made up a significant proportion of the population under investi gation.

"(This passage is excerpted from material published in 1980.)  
Federal efforts to aid minority businesses began in the 1960s when the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) began making federally guaranteed loans and government -sponsor ed 
management and technical assistance available to minority business enterprises. While this 
program enabled many minority entrepreneurs to form new businesses, the results were 
disappointing, since managerial inexperience, unfavorable locations, and capi tal shortages led  GMAT  31 
 to high failure rates. Even  years after the program was implemented, minority business receipts 
were not quite two percent of the national economys total receipts.  
Recently federal policymakers have adopted an approach intended to accele rate 
development of the minority business sector by moving away from directly aiding small minority 
enterprises and toward supporting larger, growth -oriented minority firms through intermediary 
companies. In this approach, large corporations participate in  the development of successful 
and stable minority businesses by making use of government -sponsored venture capital. The 
capital is used by a participating company to establish a Minority Enterprise Small Business 
Investment Company or MESBIC. The MESBIC t hen provides capital and guidance to minority 
businesses that have potential to become future suppliers or customers of the sponsoring 
company.  
MESBICs are the result of the belief that providing established firms with easier access to 
relevant management  techniques and more job -specific experience, as well as substantial 
amounts of capital, gives those firms a greater opportunity to develop sound business 
foundations than does simply making general management experience and small amounts of 
capital availa ble. Further, since potential markets for the minority businesses already exist 
through the sponsoring companies, the minority businesses face considerably less risk in terms 
of location and market fluctuation. Following early financial and operating probl ems, sponsoring 
corporations began to capitalize MESBICs far above the legal minimum of $500,000 in order to 
generate sufficient income and to sustain the quality of management needed. MESBIC s are 
now emerging as increasingly important financing sources for minority enterprises.  
Ironically, MESBIC staffs, which usually consist of Hispanic and Black professionals, tend to 
approach investments in minority firms more pragmatically than do many MESBIC directors, 
who are usually senior managers from sponsoring  corporations. The latter often still think 
mainly in terms of the social responsibility approach and thus seem to prefer deals that are 
riskier and less attractive than normal investment criteria would warrant. Such differences in 
viewpoint have produce d uneasiness among many minority staff members, who feel that

Federal efforts to aid minority businesses began in the 1960s when the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) began making federally guaranteed loans and government -sponsor ed 
management and technical assistance available to minority business enterprises. While this 
program enabled many minority entrepreneurs to form new businesses, the results were 
disappointing, since managerial inexperience, unfavorable locations, and capi tal shortages led  GMAT  31 
 to high failure rates. Even  years after the program was implemented, minority business receipts 
were not quite two percent of the national economys total receipts.  
Recently federal policymakers have adopted an approach intended to accele rate 
development of the minority business sector by moving away from directly aiding small minority 
enterprises and toward supporting larger, growth -oriented minority firms through intermediary 
companies. In this approach, large corporations participate in  the development of successful 
and stable minority businesses by making use of government -sponsored venture capital. The 
capital is used by a participating company to establish a Minority Enterprise Small Business 
Investment Company or MESBIC. The MESBIC t hen provides capital and guidance to minority 
businesses that have potential to become future suppliers or customers of the sponsoring 
company.  
MESBICs are the result of the belief that providing established firms with easier access to 
relevant management  techniques and more job -specific experience, as well as substantial 
amounts of capital, gives those firms a greater opportunity to develop sound business 
foundations than does simply making general management experience and small amounts of 
capital availa ble. Further, since potential markets for the minority businesses already exist 
through the sponsoring companies, the minority businesses face considerably less risk in terms 
of location and market fluctuation. Following early financial and operating probl ems, sponsoring 
corporations began to capitalize MESBICs far above the legal minimum of $500,000 in order to 
generate sufficient income and to sustain the quality of management needed. MESBIC s are 
now emerging as increasingly important financing sources for minority enterprises.  
Ironically, MESBIC staffs, which usually consist of Hispanic and Black professionals, tend to 
approach investments in minority firms more pragmatically than do many MESBIC directors, 
who are usually senior managers from sponsoring  corporations. The latter often still think 
mainly in terms of the social responsibility approach and thus seem to prefer deals that are

Camels, on the other hand, rely more on simple endurance. They cannot store water , and 
their reliance on an entirely unexceptional kidney results in a r ate of water loss through renal 
function significantly higher than that of desert rats. As a result, camels must tolerate losses in 
body water of up to thirty percent of their body weight. Nevertheless , camels do rely on a 
special mechanism to keep water l oss within a tolerable range: by seating and panting only 
when their body temperature exceeds that which would kill a human, they conserve internal 
water.  
Marine vertebrates experience difficulty with their water balance because though there is 
no shortage  of seawater to drink, they must drink a lot of it to maintain their internal fluid 
balance.  But the excess salts from the seawater must be discharged somehow, and the kidneys 
of most marine vertebrates are unable to excrete a urine in which the salts are more 
concentrated than in seawater. Most of these animals have special salt -secreting organs outside 
the kidney that enable them to eliminate excess salt.

"Homeostasis, an animals maintenance of certain internal variables within an acceptable 
range, particularly in  extreme physical environments, has long interested biologists. The desert 
rat and the camel in the most water -deprived environments, and marine vertebrates in an 
all-water environment, encounter the same regulatory problem: maintaining adequate internal 
fluid balance.  
For desert rats and camels, the problem is conservation of water in an environment where 
standing water is nonexistent, temperature is high, and humidity is low. Despite these 
handicaps, desert rats are able to maintain the osmotic pressure o f their blood, as well as their 
total bo dy-water content, at approximately the same levels as other rats. One countermeasure

"The majority of successful senior managers do not closely follow the classical rational 
model of first clarifying goals, assessing the problem, formulating opti ons, estimating 
likelihoods of success, making a decision, and only then taking action to implement the decision. 
Rather, in their day-by-day tactical maneuvers, these senior executives rely on what is vaguely 
termed intuition to manage a network of interrelated problems that require them to deal with 
ambiguity, inconsistency, novelty, and surprise; and to integrate action into the process o f 
thinking.  
Generations of writers on management have recognized that some practicing managers 
rely heavily on intuition. In general, however, such writers display a poor grasp of what intuition 
is. Some see it as the opposite of rationality ; others view it as an excuse for capriciousness.  
Isenbergs recent research on the c ognitive processes of senior managers reveals that 
managers intuition is neither of these. Rather, senior managers use intuition in at least five 
distinct ways. First, they intuitively sense when a problem exists. Second, managers rely on 
intuition to per form well -learned behavior patterns rapidly. This intuition is not arbitrary or 
irrational, but is based on years of painstaking practice and hands -on experience that build 
skills. A third function of intuition is to synthesize isolated bits of data and pr actice into an 
integrated picture, often in an Aha! experience. Fourth, some managers use intuition as a 
check on the results of more rational analysis. Most senior executives are familiar with the 
formal decision analysis models and tools, and those who  use such systematic methods for 
reaching decisions are occasionally leery of solutions suggested by these methods which run 
counter to  their sense of the correct course of action. Finally, managers can use intuition to 
bypass in -depth analysis and move rapidly to engender a plausible solution. Used in this way, 
intuition is an almost instantaneous cognitive process in which a ma nager recognizes familiar 
patterns. One of the implications of the intuitive style of executive management is that 
thinking is inseparable from acting. Since managers often know what is right before they 
can analyze and explain it, they frequently act first and explain later. Analysis is inextricably tied 
to action in thinking/acting cycles, in which managers develop thoughts about their companies 
and organizations not by analyzing a problematic situation and then acting, but by acting and 
analyzing in close concert.  
Given the great uncertainty of many of the management issues that they face, senior 
managers often instigate a course of action simply to learn more about an issue. They then use 
the results of the action to develop a more complete understan ding of the issue. One 
implication of thinking/acting cycles is that action is often part of defining the problem, not just  GMAT  35 
 of implementing the solution.","According to the passage, senior managers use intuition in all of the following

is. Some see it as the opposite of rationality ; others view it as an excuse for capriciousness.  
Isenbergs recent research on the c ognitive processes of senior managers reveals that 
managers intuition is neither of these. Rather, senior managers use intuition in at least five 
distinct ways. First, they intuitively sense when a problem exists. Second, managers rely on 
intuition to per form well -learned behavior patterns rapidly. This intuition is not arbitrary or 
irrational, but is based on years of painstaking practice and hands -on experience that build 
skills. A third function of intuition is to synthesize isolated bits of data and pr actice into an 
integrated picture, often in an Aha! experience. Fourth, some managers use intuition as a 
check on the results of more rational analysis. Most senior executives are familiar with the 
formal decision analysis models and tools, and those who  use such systematic methods for 
reaching decisions are occasionally leery of solutions suggested by these methods which run 
counter to  their sense of the correct course of action. Finally, managers can use intuition to 
bypass in -depth analysis and move rapidly to engender a plausible solution. Used in this way, 
intuition is an almost instantaneous cognitive process in which a ma nager recognizes familiar 
patterns. One of the implications of the intuitive style of executive management is that 
thinking is inseparable from acting. Since managers often know what is right before they 
can analyze and explain it, they frequently act first and explain later. Analysis is inextricably tied 
to action in thinking/acting cycles, in which managers develop thoughts about their companies 
and organizations not by analyzing a problematic situation and then acting, but by acting and 
analyzing in close concert.  
Given the great uncertainty of many of the management issues that they face, senior 
managers often instigate a course of action simply to learn more about an issue. They then use 
the results of the action to develop a more complete understan ding of the issue. One 
implication of thinking/acting cycles is that action is often part of defining the problem, not just  GMAT  35 
 of implementing the solution.","The passage suggests which of the following about the writers on man agement

"Nearly a century ago, biologists found that if they separated an invertebrate animal embryo 
into two parts at an early stage of its life, it would survive and develop as tw o normal embryos. 
This led them to believe that the cells in the early embryo are undetermined in the sense that 
each cell has the potential to develop in a variety of different ways. Later biologists found that 
the situation was not so simple. It matters in which plane the embryo is cut. If it is cut in a plane 
different from the one used by the early investigators, it will not form two whole embryos.  
A debate arose over what exactly was happening. Which embryo cells are determined, just 
when do they  becom e irreversibly committed to their fates, and what are the morphogenetic 
determinants that tell a cell what to become? But the debate could not be resolved because no 
one was able to ask the crucial questions in a form in which they could be pursued produ ctively. 
Recent discoveries in molecular biology, however, have opened up prospects for a resolution of 
the debate. Now investigators think they know at least some of the molecules that act as 
morphogenetic determinants in early development. They have been  able to show that, in a 
sense, cell determination begins even before an egg is fertilized.

"Nearly a century ago, biologists found that if they separated an invertebrate animal embryo 
into two parts at an early stage of its life, it would survive and develop as tw o normal embryos. 
This led them to believe that the cells in the early embryo are undetermined in the sense that 
each cell has the potential to develop in a variety of different ways. Later biologists found that 
the situation was not so simple. It matters in which plane the embryo is cut. If it is cut in a plane 
different from the one used by the early investigators, it will not form two whole embryos.  
A debate arose over what exactly was happening. Which embryo cells are determined, just 
when do they  becom e irreversibly committed to their fates, and what are the morphogenetic 
determinants that tell a cell what to become? But the debate could not be resolved because no 
one was able to ask the crucial questions in a form in which they could be pursued produ ctively. 
Recent discoveries in molecular biology, however, have opened up prospects for a resolution of 
the debate. Now investigators think they know at least some of the molecules that act as 
morphogenetic determinants in early development. They have been  able to show that, in a 
sense, cell determination begins even before an egg is fertilized.  
Studying sea urchins , biolog ist Paul Gross found that an unfertilized egg contains 
substances that function as morphogenetic determinants. They are located in the cytoplasm of 
the egg cell; i.e., in that part of the cells protoplasm that lies outside of the nucleus. In the 
unfertili zed egg, the substances are inactive and are not distributed homogeneously. When the 
egg is fertilized, the substances become active and, presumably, govern the behavior of the 
genes they interact with. Since the substances are unevenly distributed in the egg, when the 
fertilized egg divides, the resulting cells are different from the start and so can be qualitatively 
different in their own gene activity.  
The substances that Gross studied are maternal messenger RNAs products of certain of 
the maternal gene s. He and other biologists studying a wide variety of organisms have found 
that these particular RNAs direct, in large part, the synthesis of histones, a class of proteins 
that bind to DNA. Once synthesized, the histones move into the cell nucleus, where section of 
DNA wrap around them to form a structure that resembles beads, or knots, on a string. The 
beads are DNA segments wrapped around the histones; the string is the intervening DNA. And

"In the two decades between 1910 and 1930, over ten percent o f the Black p opulation of 
the United States left the South, where the preponderance of the Black population had been 
located, and migrated to northern states, with the largest number moving, it is claimed, 
between 1916 and 1918.  It has been frequently assumed, but not proved, that the majority of 
the migrants in what has come to be called the Great Migration came from rural areas and were 
motivated by two concurrent factors: the collapse of the cotton industry following the boll 
weevil  infestation, which began in 1898, and increased demand in the North for labor following 
the cessation of European immigration caused by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.  
This assumption has led to the conclusion that the migrants subsequ ent lack of economic 
mobility in the North is tied to rural background, a background that implies unfamiliarity with 
urban living and a lack of industrial skills.  
But the question of who actually left the South has never been rigorously investigated. 
Although numerous investigations document an exodus from rural southern areas to southern 
cities prior to the Great Migration , no one has considered whether the same migrants then 
moved on to northern cities. In 1910 over 600,0 00 Black workers, or ten percent o f the Black 
work force, reported themselves to be engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits,

Migration could easily have been made up entirely of this group a nd their families. It is perhaps 
surprising to argue that an employed population could be enticed to move, but an explanation 
lies in the labor conditions then prevalent in the South.  
About thirty -five percent of the urban Black population in the South was  engaged in skilled 
trades. Some were from the old artisan class of slavery blacksmiths , masons, 
carpenters which  had had a monopoly of certain trades, but they were gradually being pushed

the migrants in what has come to be called the Great Migration came from rural areas and were 
motivated by two concurrent factors: the collapse of the cotton industry following the boll 
weevil  infestation, which began in 1898, and increased demand in the North for labor following 
the cessation of European immigration caused by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.  
This assumption has led to the conclusion that the migrants subsequ ent lack of economic

urban living and a lack of industrial skills.  
But the question of who actually left the South has never been rigorously investigated. 
Although numerous investigations document an exodus from rural southern areas to southern 
cities prior to the Great Migration , no one has considered whether the same migrants then 
moved on to northern cities. In 1910 over 600,0 00 Black workers, or ten percent o f the Black 
work force, reported themselves to be engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits,

surprising to argue that an employed population could be enticed to move, but an explanation 
lies in the labor conditions then prevalent in the South.  
About thirty -five percent of the urban Black population in the South was  engaged in skilled

For Zelizer the origins of this transformation were many and complex. The gradual erosion 
of childrens productive value in a maturing industri al economy, the decline in birth and death

liability for damages. In contrast, less than a century later, in 1979, the parents of a 
three-year-old sued in New York for accidental -death damages and won an award of $750,000.  
The transformation in social values implicit in juxtaposing these two incidents is the subject  GMAT  43 
 of Viviana Zelizers excellent book, Pricing the Priceless Child . During the nineteenth century, 
she argues, the concept of the useful ch ild who contributed to the family economy gave way 
gradually to the present -day notion of the useless child who, though producing no income for, 
and indeed extremely costly to, its parents, is yet considered emotionally priceless. Well 
established amon g segments of the middle and upper classes by the mid -1800s, this new view 
of childhood spread throughout society in the late-nineteenth and early -twentieth centuries as 
reformers introduced child -labor regulations and compulsory education  laws predicated in part 
on the assumption that a childs emotional value made child labor taboo.  
For Zelizer the origins of this transformation were many and complex. The gradual erosion 
of childrens productive value in a maturing industri al economy, the decline in birth and death 
rates, especially in child mortality, and the development of the companionate family (a family in 
which members were united by explicit bonds of love rather than duty) were all factors critical 
in changing the ass essment of childrens worth. Yet expulsion of children from the  cash nexus , 
although clearly shaped by profound changes in the economic, occupational, and family 
structures, Zelizer maintains, was also part of a cultural process of sacrelization of childrens 
lives. Protecting children from the crass busines s world became enormously important for 
late-nineteenth -century middle -class Americans, she suggests; this sacralization was a way of 
resisting what they perceived as the relentless corruption of human values by the marketplace.  
In stressing the cultural d eterminants of a childs worth , Zelizer takes issue with 
practitioners of the new sociological economics, who have analyzed such traditionally 
sociological topics as crime, marriage, education, and health solely in terms of their economic 
determinants. A llowing only a small role for cultural forces in the form of individual 
preferences, these sociologists tend to view all human behaviors as directed primarily by the 
principle of maximizing economic gain. Zelizer is highly critical of this approach, and

The factors favoring unionization drives seem to have been \neither the presence of large numbers of workers, as in New York Cit y, to make it worth the \neffort, or the concentration of small numbers in one or two locations, such as a hospital, to \nmake it relatively easy . Receptivity to unionization on the workers part was also a consideration, \nbut when there were large numbers invo lved or the clerical workers were the only unorganized \ngroup in a jurisdiction, the multi -occupational unions would often try to organize them \nregardless of the workers initial receptivity. The strategic reasoning was based, first, on the \nconcern that pol iticians and administrators might play off  unionized against non -unionized \nworkers, and, second, on the conviction that a fully unionized public work force meant power, \nboth at the bargaining table and in the legislature. In localities where clerical workers were few \nin number, were scattered in several workplaces, and expressed no interest in being organized, \nunions more often than not ignored them in the pre -1975 period.  \nBut since the mid -1970s, a different strategy has emerged. In 1977, 34 percent of \ngovernment clerical workers we re represented by a labor organization, compared with 46 \npercent of government professionals, 44 percent of government blue -collar workers, and 41 \npercent of government service workers . Since then, however, the biggest increases in \npublic -sector unionizati on have been among clerical workers. Between 19 77 and 1980, the \nnumber of unionized government workers in blue -collar and service occupations increased only \nabout  1.5 percent, while in the white -collar occupations the increase was 20 percent and \namong cler ical workers in particular, the increase was 22 percent.  \nWhat accounts for this upsurge in unionization among clerical workers? First, more women \nhave entered the work force in the past few years, and more of them plan to remain working \nuntil retirement ag e. Consequently, they are probably more concerned than their predecessors \nwere about job security and economic benefits. Also, the womens movement has succeeded in 46 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    \n legitimizing the economic and political activism of women on their own behalf, thereby \nproducing a more positive attitude toward unions. The absence of any comparable increase in \nunionization among private -sector clerical workers, however, identifies the primary \ncatalyst the structural change in the multi -occupational public -sector unions themse lves. Over \nthe past twenty years, the occupational distribution in these unions has been steadily shifting \nfrom predominantly blue -collar to predominantly white -collar. Because there are far more \nwomen in white -collar jobs, an increase in the proportion of  female members has accompanied \nthe occupational shift and has altered union policy -making in favor of organizing women and \naddressing womens issues.'}"

liability for damages. In contrast, less than a century later, in 1979, the parents of a 
three-year-old sued in New York for accidental -death damages and won an award of $750,000.  
The transformation in social values implicit in juxtaposing these two incidents is the subject  GMAT  43 
 of Viviana Zelizers excellent book, Pricing the Priceless Child . During the nineteenth century, 
she argues, the concept of the useful ch ild who contributed to the family economy gave way 
gradually to the present -day notion of the useless child who, though producing no income for, 
and indeed extremely costly to, its parents, is yet considered emotionally priceless. Well 
established amon g segments of the middle and upper classes by the mid -1800s, this new view 
of childhood spread throughout society in the late-nineteenth and early -twentieth centuries as 
reformers introduced child -labor regulations and compulsory education  laws predicated in part 
on the assumption that a childs emotional value made child labor taboo.  
For Zelizer the origins of this transformation were many and complex. The gradual erosion 
of childrens productive value in a maturing industri al economy, the decline in birth and death 
rates, especially in child mortality, and the development of the companionate family (a family in 
which members were united by explicit bonds of love rather than duty) were all factors critical 
in changing the ass essment of childrens worth. Yet expulsion of children from the  cash nexus , 
although clearly shaped by profound changes in the economic, occupational, and family 
structures, Zelizer maintains, was also part of a cultural process of sacrelization of childrens 
lives. Protecting children from the crass busines s world became enormously important for 
late-nineteenth -century middle -class Americans, she suggests; this sacralization was a way of 
resisting what they perceived as the relentless corruption of human values by the marketplace.  
In stressing the cultural d eterminants of a childs worth , Zelizer takes issue with 
practitioners of the new sociological economics, who have analyzed such traditionally 
sociological topics as crime, marriage, education, and health solely in terms of their economic 
determinants. A llowing only a small role for cultural forces in the form of individual 
preferences, these sociologists tend to view all human behaviors as directed primarily by the 
principle of maximizing economic gain. Zelizer is highly critical of this approach, and 
emphasizes instead the opposite phenomenon: the power of social values to transform price.

"Milankovitch proposed in the early twentieth century that the ice ages were caused by 
variations in the Earths orbit around the Sun. For sometime this theory was considered 
untestable, largel y because there was no sufficiently precise chronology of the ice ages with 
which the orbital variations could be matched.  
To establish such a chronology it is necessary to determine the relative amounts of land ice 
that existed at various times in the Ear ths past. A recent discovery makes such a determination 
possible: relative land -ice volume for a given period can be deduced from the ratio of two 
oxygen isotopes, 16 and 18, found in ocean sediments. Almost all the oxygen in water is oxygen 
16, but a few  molecules out of every thousand incorporate the heavier isotope 18. When an ice 
age begins, the continental ice sheets grow, steadily reducing the amount of water evaporated 
from the ocean that will eventually return to it. Because heavier isotopes tend t o be left behi nd 
when water evaporates from the ocean surfaces, the remaining ocean water becomes 
progressively enriched in oxygen 18. The degree of enrichment can be determined by analyzing 
ocean sediments of the period, because these sediments are compos ed of calcium carbonate  
shells of marine organisms, shells that were constructed with oxygen atoms drawn from the 
surrounding ocean. The higher the ratio of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 in a sedimentary specimen, 
the more land ice t here was when the sediment was laid down.  
As an indicator of shifts in the Earths climate, the isotope record has two advantages. First, 
it is a global record: there is remarkably little variation in isotope ratios in sedimentary 
specimens taken from diff erent continental locations. Second, it is a more continuous record 
than that taken from rocks on land. Because of these advantages, sedimentary evidence can be 
dated with sufficient accuracy by radiometric methods to establish a precise chronology of the 
ice ages. The dated isotope record shows that the fluctuations in global ice volume over the 
past several hundred thousand years have a pattern: an ice age occurs roughly once every 
100,000 years. These data have established a strong connection between var iations in the 
Earths orbit and the periodicity of the ice ages.   GMAT  49 
 However, it is important to note that other factors, such as volcanic particulates or 
variations in the amount of sunlight received by the Earth, could potentially have affected the 
climate.  The advantage of the Milankovitch theory is that it is testable: changes in the Earths 
orbit can be calculated and dated by applying Newtons laws of gravity to progressively earlier 
configurations of the bodies in the solar system. Yet the lack of infor mation about other possible

"Milankovitch proposed in the early twentieth century that the ice ages were caused by 
variations in the Earths orbit around the Sun. For sometime this theory was considered 
untestable, largel y because there was no sufficiently precise chronology of the ice ages with 
which the orbital variations could be matched.  
To establish such a chronology it is necessary to determine the relative amounts of land ice 
that existed at various times in the Ear ths past. A recent discovery makes such a determination 
possible: relative land -ice volume for a given period can be deduced from the ratio of two 
oxygen isotopes, 16 and 18, found in ocean sediments. Almost all the oxygen in water is oxygen 
16, but a few  molecules out of every thousand incorporate the heavier isotope 18. When an ice 
age begins, the continental ice sheets grow, steadily reducing the amount of water evaporated 
from the ocean that will eventually return to it. Because heavier isotopes tend t o be left behi nd 
when water evaporates from the ocean surfaces, the remaining ocean water becomes 
progressively enriched in oxygen 18. The degree of enrichment can be determined by analyzing 
ocean sediments of the period, because these sediments are compos ed of calcium carbonate  
shells of marine organisms, shells that were constructed with oxygen atoms drawn from the 
surrounding ocean. The higher the ratio of oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 in a sedimentary specimen, 
the more land ice t here was when the sediment was laid down.  
As an indicator of shifts in the Earths climate, the isotope record has two advantages. First, 
it is a global record: there is remarkably little variation in isotope ratios in sedimentary 
specimens taken from diff erent continental locations. Second, it is a more continuous record 
than that taken from rocks on land. Because of these advantages, sedimentary evidence can be 
dated with sufficient accuracy by radiometric methods to establish a precise chronology of the 
ice ages. The dated isotope record shows that the fluctuations in global ice volume over the 
past several hundred thousand years have a pattern: an ice age occurs roughly once every 
100,000 years. These data have established a strong connection between var iations in the 
Earths orbit and the periodicity of the ice ages.   GMAT  49 
 However, it is important to note that other factors, such as volcanic particulates or 
variations in the amount of sunlight received by the Earth, could potentially have affected the 
climate.  The advantage of the Milankovitch theory is that it is testable: changes in the Earths 
orbit can be calculated and dated by applying Newtons laws of gravity to progressively earlier

"Bernard Bailyn has recently reinterpreted the early history of the United State s by applying

their countryside; migrating to the New World was simply a natural spillover. Although at first 
the colonies held little positive attraction for the English they would rather have stayed 
home by the eighteenth century people increasingly migrated to America because they 
regarded it as the land of opportunity. Secondly, Bailyn holds that, contrary to the notion that 
used to flourish in America history textbooks, the re was never a typical New World community. 
For example, the economic and demographic character of early New England towns varied 
considerably.  
Bailyns third proposition suggests two general patterns prevailing among the many 
thousands of migrants: one gr oup came as indentured servants, another came to acquire land. 
Surprisingly, Bailyn suggests that those who recruited indentured servants were the driving 
forces of transatlantic migration. These colonial entrepreneurs helped determine the social 
character  of people who came to preindustrial North America. At first, thousands of unskilled 
laborers were recruited; by the 1730s, however, American employers demanded skilled 
artisans.  
Finally, Bailyn argues that the colonies were a half -civilized hinterland of  the European 
culture system. He is undoubtedly correct to insist that the colonies were part of an 
Anglo -American empire. But to divide the empire into English core and colonial periphery, as 
Bailyn does, devalues the achievements of colonial culture. It is true, as Bailyn claims, that high 
culture in the colonies never matched that in England. But what of  seventeenth -century New 
England, where the settlers created eff ective laws, built a distinguished university, and 
published books? Bailyn might respond that New England was exceptional. However, the ideas 
and institutions developed by New England Puritans had powerful effects on North American 
culture.  
Although Bailyn  goes on to apply his approach to some thousands of indentured servants 
who migrated just prior to the revolution, he fails to link their experience with the political 
development of the United States. Evidence presented in his work suggests how we might 
make such a connection. These indentured servants were treated as slaves for the period 
during which they had sold their time to American employers. It is not surprising that as soon as 
they served their time they passed up  good wages in th e cities and headed west to ensure their

"No very satisfactory account of the mechanism that caused the formation of the ocean 
basins has yet been given. The traditional view supposes that the upper mantle of the earth 
behaves as a liquid when it is subjected to small forces for long periods and that differences in 
temperature under oceans and continents are sufficient to produce convection in the mantle of 
the earth with rising convection currents under the mid -ocean ridges and sinking currents 
under the continents. Theoretically, this convection  would carry the continental plates along as 
though they were on a conveyor belt  and would provide the forces needed to produce the split 
that occurs along the ridge. This view may be correct: it has the advantage that the currents 
are driven by temperature differences that themselves depend on the position of the continents. 
Such a back -coupling, in which the position of the moving plate has an impact on the forces 
that move it, could produce complicated and varying motions.  
On the other hand, the theory is implausible because convection does not normally occur 
along lines , and it certainly does not occur along lines broken by frequent offsets  or changes in 
direction, as the ridge is. Also it is difficult to see how the theory applies to the plate between  GMAT  7 
 the Mid -Atlantic Ridge and the ridge in the Indian Ocean. This plate is growing on both sides, 
and since there is no intermediate trench, the two ridges must  be moving apart. It would be 
odd if the rising convection currents kept exact pace with them. An alternative theory is that the 
sinking part of the plate, which is denser than the hotter surrounding mantle, pulls the rest of 
the plate after it. Again it i s difficult to see how this applies to the ridge in the South Atlantic, 
where neither the African nor the American plate has a sinking part.  
Another possibility is that the sinking plate cools the neighboring mantle and produces 
convection currents that mo ve the plates. This last theory is attractive because it gives some 
hope of explaining the enclosed seas, such as the Sea of Japan. These seas have a typical 
oceanic floor, except that the floor is overlaid by several kilometers of sediment. Their floors 
have probably been sinking for long periods. It seems possible that a sinking current of cooled 
mantle material on the upper side of the plate might be the cause of such deep basins. The

temperature under oceans and continents are sufficient to produce convection in the mantle of 
the earth with rising convection currents under the mid -ocean ridges and sinking currents 
under the continents. Theoretically, this convection  would carry the continental plates along as 
though they were on a conveyor belt  and would provide the forces needed to produce the split 
that occurs along the ridge. This view may be correct: it has the advantage that the currents 
are driven by temperature differences that themselves depend on the position of the continents. 
Such a back -coupling, in which the position of the moving plate has an impact on the forces 
that move it, could produce complicated and varying motions.  
On the other hand, the theory is implausible because convection does not normally occur 
along lines , and it certainly does not occur along lines broken by frequent offsets  or changes in 
direction, as the ridge is. Also it is difficult to see how the theory applies to the plate between  GMAT  7 
 the Mid -Atlantic Ridge and the ridge in the Indian Ocean. This plate is growing on both sides, 
and since there is no intermediate trench, the two ridges must  be moving apart. It would be 
odd if the rising convection currents kept exact pace with them. An alternative theory is that the 
sinking part of the plate, which is denser than the hotter surrounding mantle, pulls the rest of 
the plate after it. Again it i s difficult to see how this applies to the ridge in the South Atlantic, 
where neither the African nor the American plate has a sinking part.  
Another possibility is that the sinking plate cools the neighboring mantle and produces 
convection currents that mo ve the plates. This last theory is attractive because it gives some 
hope of explaining the enclosed seas, such as the Sea of Japan. These seas have a typical 
oceanic floor, except that the floor is overlaid by several kilometers of sediment. Their floors 
have probably been sinking for long periods. It seems possible that a sinking current of cooled 
mantle material on the upper side of the plate might be the cause of such deep basins. The 
enclosed seas are an important feature of the earths surface, and ser iously require explanation

The United States company claiming injury was a subsidiary of a Dutch conglomerate, while 
the Canadian companies  included a subsidiary of a Chicago firm that was the second -largest 
domestic producer of rock salt.","According to the passage, companies have the general impression that

Trade Commission (ITC) has received about 280 complaints alleging damage from imports that 
benefit from subsidies by foreign governments. Another 340 charge th at foreign companies 60 GMAT, GRE, LSAT

"All of the cells in a particular plant start out  with the same complement of genes. How then 
can these cel ls differentiate and form structures as different as roots, stems, leaves, and fruits? 
The answer is that only a small subset of the genes in a particular kind of cell are expressed, or 
turned on, at a given time. This is accomplished by a complex system o f chemical messengers 
that in plants include hormones and other regulatory molecules. Five major hormones have 
been identified: auxin, abscisic acid , cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellin. Studies of plants have 
now identified a new class of regulatory molecules called oligosaccharins.  
Unlike the oligosaccharins, the five well -known plant hormones are pleiotropic rather than 
specific; that is, e ach has more than one effect on the growth and development of plants. The 
five has so many simultaneous effects that they are not very useful in artificially controlling the 
growth of crops. Auxin, for instance, stimulates the rate of cell elongation, caus es shoots to 
grow up and roots to grow down, and inhibits the growth of lateral shoots. Auxin also causes 
the plant to develop a vascular system, to form lateral roots, and to produce ethylene.  
The pleiotropy of the five well -studied plant hormones is some what analogous to that of 
certain hormones in animal. For example, hormones from the hypothalamus in the brain 
stimulate the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland  to synthesize and release many different 
hormones, one of which s timulates the release of hormones from the adrenal cortex . These 
hormones have specific effects on target organs all over the body. One hormone stimulates the 
thyroid gland, for example, another the ovarian follicle  cells, and so forth. In other words, there 
is a hierarchy of hormones. Such a hierarchy may also exist in plants. Oligosaccharins are 
fragments of the cell wall released by enzymes: different enzymes release different 
oligosaccharins. There are indi cations that pleiotropic plant hormones may actually function by

certain hormones in animal. For example, hormones from the hypothalamus in the brain 
stimulate the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland  to synthesize and release many different 
hormones, one of which s timulates the release of hormones from the adrenal cortex . These 
hormones have specific effects on target organs all over the body. One hormone stimulates the 
thyroid gland, for example, another the ovarian follicle  cells, and so forth. In other words, there 
is a hierarchy of hormones. Such a hierarchy may also exist in plants. Oligosaccharins are 
fragments of the cell wall released by enzymes: different enzymes release different 
oligosaccharins. There are indi cations that pleiotropic plant hormones may actually function by 
activating the enzymes that release these other, more specific chemical messengers from the 
cell wall.","The author mentions specific effects that auxin has on plant development in order

"All of the cells in a particular plant start out  with the same complement of genes. How then

The answer is that only a small subset of the genes in a particular kind of cell are expressed, or 
turned on, at a given time. This is accomplished by a complex system o f chemical messengers 
that in plants include hormones and other regulatory molecules. Five major hormones have 
been identified: auxin, abscisic acid , cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellin. Studies of plants have 
now identified a new class of regulatory molecules called oligosaccharins.  
Unlike the oligosaccharins, the five well -known plant hormones are pleiotropic rather than 
specific; that is, e ach has more than one effect on the growth and development of plants. The 
five has so many simultaneous effects that they are not very useful in artificially controlling the 
growth of crops. Auxin, for instance, stimulates the rate of cell elongation, caus es shoots to 
grow up and roots to grow down, and inhibits the growth of lateral shoots. Auxin also causes

"In 1977 the prestigious Ewha Womens University in Seoul, Korea, announced the opening 
of the first womens studies program in Asia. Few academic programs have eve r received such 
public attention. In broadcast debates, critics dismissed the program as a betrayal of national 
identity, an imitation of Western ideas, and a distraction from the real task of national 
unification and economic development. Even supporters underestimated the program; they 
thought it would be merely another of the many Western ideas that had already proved useful 
in Asian culture, akin to airlines, electricity, and the assembly line. The founders of the program, 
however, realized that neither  view was correct. They had some reservations about the 
applicability of Western feminist theories to the role of women in Asia and felt that such theories 
should be closely examined. Their approach has thus far  yielded important critiques o f Western 
theory, informed by the special experience of Asian women.  
For instance, like the Western feminist critique of the Freudian model of the human psyche, 
the Korean critique finds Freudian theory culture -bound, but in ways different from those cited  
by Western theorists. The Korean theorists claim that Freudian theory assumes the universality 
of the Western nuclear, male -headed family and focuses on the personality formation of the 
individual, independent of  society . An analysis based on such assumptions could be valid for a 
highly competitive, individualistic society. In the Freudian family drama , family members are 
assumed to be engaged in a Darwinian struggle against each other father against son and 
sibling against sibling. Such a concept projects the competitive model of Western society onto 
human personalities. But in the Asian concept of personal ity there is no ideal attached to 
individualism or to the independent self. The Western model of personality development does 
not explain major characteristics of the Korean personality, which is social and group -centered. 
The self is a social being defi ned by and acting in a group, and the well -being of both men 
and women is determined by the equilibrium of the group, not by individual self-assertion . The 
ideal is one of interdependency.

in Korean terms, an admission of weakness or failure. All this bears directly on the Asian 
perception o f mens and womens psychology because men are also dependent . In Korean 
culture, men cry and otherwise easily show their emotions, something that might be considered 
a betrayal of masculinity in Western culture. In the kinship -based society of Korea, fo ur

identity, an imitation of Western ideas, and a distraction from the real task of national

applicability of Western feminist theories to the role of women in Asia and felt that such theories

theory, informed by the special experience of Asian women.  
For instance, like the Western feminist critique of the Freudian model of the human psyche, 
the Korean critique finds Freudian theory culture -bound, but in ways different from those cited  
by Western theorists. The Korean theorists claim that Freudian theory assumes the universality 
of the Western nuclear, male -headed family and focuses on the personality formation of the 
individual, independent of  society . An analysis based on such assumptions could be valid for a 
highly competitive, individualistic society. In the Freudian family drama , family members are 
assumed to be engaged in a Darwinian struggle against each other father against son and 
sibling against sibling. Such a concept projects the competitive model of Western society onto 
human personalities. But in the Asian concept of personal ity there is no ideal attached to 
individualism or to the independent self. The Western model of personality development does 
not explain major characteristics of the Korean personality, which is social and group -centered. 
The self is a social being defi ned by and acting in a group, and the well -being of both men 
and women is determined by the equilibrium of the group, not by individual self-assertion . The 
ideal is one of interdependency.  
In such a context, what is recognized as dependency in Western psychiatric terms is not, 
in Korean terms, an admission of weakness or failure. All this bears directly on the Asian 
perception o f mens and womens psychology because men are also dependent . In Korean 
culture, men cry and otherwise easily show their emotions, something that might be considered 
a betrayal of masculinity in Western culture. In the kinship -based society of Korea, fo ur

"In choosing a method for determining climatic conditions that existed in the past, 
paleoc limatologists invoke four principal criteria. First, the material rocks, lakes, vegetation, 
etc.on which the method relies must be widespread enough to provide plenty of information, 
since analysis of material that is rarely encountered will not permit co rrelation with other 
regions or with other periods of geological history. Second, in the process of formation, the 
material must have received an environmental signal that reflects a change in climate and that 
can be deciphered by modern physical or chemic al means. Third, at least some of the material 
must have retained the signal unaffected by subsequent changes in the environment. Fourth, it 
must be possible to determine the time at which the inferred climatic conditions held. This last 
criterion is more easily met in dating marine sediments, because dating of only a small number 
of layers in a marine sequence allows the age of other layers to be estimated fairly reliably by 
extrapolation and interpolation. By contrast, because sedimentation is much less c ontinuous in 
continental regions, estimating the age of a continental bed from the known ages of beds 
above and below is more risky.  
One very old method used in the investigation of past climatic conditions involves the 
measurement of water levels in ancie nt lakes. In temperate regions, there are enough lakes for 
correlations between them to give us a reliable picture. In arid and semiarid regions, on the 
other hand, the small number of lakes and the great distances between them reduce the 
possibilities for  correlation. Moreover, since lake levels are controlled by rates of evaporation as 
well as by precipitation, the interpretation of such levels is ambiguous. For instance, the fact 
that lake levels in the semiarid southwestern United States appear to have been higher during 
the last ice age than they are now was at one time attributed to increased precipitation. On the 
basis of snow -line elevations, however, it has been concluded that the climate then was not 
necessarily wetter than it is now, but rather th at both summers and winters were cooler, 
resulting in reduced evaporation.  
Another problematic method is to reconstruct former climates on the basis of pollen 
profiles. The type of vegetation in a specific region is determined by identifying and counting 
the various pollen grains found there. Although the relationship between vegetation and 
climate is not as direct as the relationship between climate and lake levels, the method often

"Since the late 1970s, in the face of a severe loss of market share  in dozens of industries, 
manufacturers in the United States have been trying to improve productivity and therefore 
enhance their international competitiveness through cost -cutting programs. (Cost -cutting 
here is defined as raising labor  output while holding the amount of labor constant.) However, 
from 1978 through 1982, productivity the value of goods manufactured divided by the amount 
of labor input did not improve; and while the results were better in the business upturn of the 
three y ears following, they ran 25 percent lower than productivity improvements during earlier, 
post-1945 upturns. At the same time, it became clear that the harder manufactures worked to 
implement cost -cutting, the more they lost their competitive edge.  
With thi s paradox in mind, I recently visited 25 companies; it became clear to me that the 
cost-cutting approach to increasing productivity is fundamentally flawed. Manufacturing 
regularly observes a 40, 40, 20 rule. Roughly 40 percent of any manufacturing -based

"Studies of the Weddell seal in the laboratory have described the physiological mechanisms 
that allow the seal to cope with the extreme oxy gen deprivation that occurs during its longest

Recent field studies, however, suggest that during more typical dives in the wild, this seals 
physiological behavior is different.  
In the laboratory, when the seal dives below the surface of the water and stops breathing, 
its heart beats more slowly, requiring less oxygen, and its arteries become constricted, ensuring 
that the seals blood remains concentrated near those  organs most crucial to its ability to 
navigate underwater. The seal essentially shuts off the flow of blood to other organs, which 
either stop functioning until the seal surfaces or switch to an anaerobic (oxygen -independent) 
metabolism. The latter result s in the production of large amounts of lactic acid  which can 
adversely affect the pH of the seals blood , but since the anaerobic metabolism occurs only in 
those tissues which have been isolated from the seals blood supply, the lactic acid is released 
into the seals blood only after the seal surfaces , when the lungs, liver, and other organs quickly

"Since the early 1970s, historians have begun to devote serious attention to the working 
class in the United States. Yet while we now have studies of working -class communities and 
culture, we know remarkably little of worklessness. When historians have paid any attention at 
all to unemployment, they have focused on the Great Depression of the 1930s. The narrowness 
of this perspective ignores the pervasive recess ions and joblessness of the previous decades, as 
Alexander Keyssar shows in his recent book. Examining the period 1870 -1920, Keyssar  GMAT  81 
 concentrates on Massachusetts, where the historical materials are particularly rich, and the 
findings applicable to other i ndustrial areas.  
The unemployment rates that Keyssar calculates appear to be relatively modest, at least by 
Great Depression standards: during the worst years, in the 1870s and 1890s, unemployment 
was around 15 percent. Yet Keyssar rightly understands th at a better way to measure the 
impact of unemployment is to calculate unemployment frequencies measuring the percentage 
of workers who experience any unemployment in the course of  a year. Given this perspective, 
joblessness looms much larger.  
Keyssar also scrutinizes unemployment patterns according to skill level, ethnicity, race, age, 
class, and gender. He finds that rates of joblessness differed primarily according to clas s: those 
in middle -class and white -collar occupations were far less likely to be unemployed. Yet the 
impact of unemployment on a specific class was not always the same. Even when dependent on 
the same trade, adjoining communities could have dramatically di fferent unemployment rates. 
Keyssar uses these differential rates to help explain a phenomenon that has puzzled 
historians the startlingly high rate of geographical mobility in the nineteenth -century United 
States. But mobility was not the dominant working -class strategy for coping with 
unemployment, nor was assistance from private charities or state agencies. Self -help and the 
help of kin got most workers through jobless spells.

of workers who experience any unemployment in the course of  a year. Given this perspective, 
joblessness looms much larger.  
Keyssar also scrutinizes unemployment patterns according to skill level, ethnicity, race, age, 
class, and gender. He finds that rates of joblessness differed primarily according to clas s: those 
in middle -class and white -collar occupations were far less likely to be unemployed. Yet the 
impact of unemployment on a specific class was not always the same. Even when dependent on 
the same trade, adjoining communities could have dramatically di fferent unemployment rates. 
Keyssar uses these differential rates to help explain a phenomenon that has puzzled 
historians the startlingly high rate of geographical mobility in the nineteenth -century United 
States. But mobility was not the dominant working -class strategy for coping with 
unemployment, nor was assistance from private charities or state agencies. Self -help and the 
help of kin got most workers through jobless spells.

 Their skulls, pelvises, and hind feet are reptilian. The anatomy of their wings sug gests that they 
did not evolve into the class of birds. In pterosaurs a greatly elongated fourth finger of each 
forelimb supported a wing -like membrane. The other fingers were short and reptilian, with 
sharp claws. In birds the second finger is the princip al strut of the wing, which consists 
primarily of feathers. If the pterosaurs walked on all fours, the three short fingers may have 
been employed for grasping. When a pterosaur walked or remained stationary, the fourth finger, 
and with it the wing, could o nly turn upward in an extended inverted V -shape along each side of 
the animals body.  
The pterosaurs resembled both birds and bats in their overall structure and proportions.

constraints. Both the pterosaurs and the birds have hollow bones, a feature that represents a

high rate of metabolism, which in turn implies a high internal temperature. Huxley speculated

could hang in preparation for flight. The second hypothesis seems unlikely because large 
pterosaurs could not have landed in t rees without damaging their wings. The third calls for high 
waves to channel updrafts. The wind that made such waves however, might have been too 
strong for the pterosaurs to control their flight once airborne.","It can be inferred from the passage that which of the following is characteris tic of

"Increasingly, his torians are blaming diseases imported from the Old World for the 
staggering disparity between the indigenous population of America in 1492 new estimates of 
which soar as high as 100 million, or approximately one -sixth of the human race at that 
timeand the  few million full-blooded  Native Americans alive at the end of the nineteenth 
century. There is no doubt that chronic disease was an important factor in the precipitous 
decline, and it is highly probable that the greatest killer was epidemic disease , especially as 
manifested in virgin -soil epidemics.  
Virgin -soil epidemics are those in which the populations at risk have had no previous 
contact with the diseases that strike them and are therefore immunologically almost 
defenseless. That virgi n-soil epidemics were important in American history is strongly indicated 
by evidence that a number of dangerous maladies smallpox, measles, malaria, yellow fever, 
and undoubtedly several more were unknown in the pre -Columbian New World. The effects of 
their sudden introduction are demonstrated in the early chronicles of America, which contain 
reports of horrendous epidemics and steep population declines, confirmed in many cases by 
recent quantitative analyses of Spanish tribute records and other sources. T he evidence 
provided by the documents of British and French colonies is not as definitive because the 
conquerors of those areas did not establish permanent settlements and begin to keep 
continuous records until the seventeenth century, by which time the wo rst epidemics had 
probably already taken place. Furthermore, the British tended to drive the native populations 
away, rather than enslaving them as the Spaniards did, so that the epidemics of British America 
occurred beyond the range of colonists direct o bservation.  
Even so, the surviving records of North America do contain references to deadly epidemics 
among the indigenous population. In 1616 -1619 an epidemic, possibly of bubonic or 
pneumonic plague, swept coastal New England, killing as many as nine out  of ten. During the 
1630s smallpox, the disease most fatal to the Native American people, eliminated half the 
population of the Huron and Iroquois confederations. In the 1820s fever devastated the people 
of the Columbia River area, killing eight out of t en of them.   GMAT  87 
 Unfortunately, the documentation of these and other epidemics is slight and frequently 
unreliable, and it is necessary to supplement what little we do know with evidence from recent 
epidemics among Native Americans. For example, in 1952 an outb reak of measles among the 
Native American inhabitants of Ungava Bay , Quebec, affected 99 percent of the population and 
killed 7 percent, even though some had the benefit of modern medicine. Cases such as this 
demonstrate that even diseases that are not nor mally fatal can have devastating consequences 
when they strike an immunologically defenseless community.","Which of the following, if newly discovered, would most seriously weaken the

depopulation of Native Americans?","{'Choice 0': 'Evidence setting the pre -Columbian  population of the New World at only 80 \nmillion', 'Choice 1': 'Spanish tribute records showing periodic population fluctuations', 'Choice 2': 'Documents detailing sophisticated Native American medical procedures', 'Choice 3': 'Fossils indicating Native American contact with smallpox prior  to 1492', 'Choice 4': 'Remains of French settlements dating back to the sixteenth century'}"
"Until recently most astronomers believed that the space between the galaxies in our

the physicist Fabian reasoned that as intergalactic gas cools, the cooler gas shrinks inward

"It can be argued that much consumer dissatisfaction with marketing strategies arises from

"Protein synthesis begins when the gene encoding a protein is activated. The genes 
sequence of nucleotides is transcribed into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA), which 
reproduces the information contained in that sequence. Transported outside the nucleus to the 
cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated into the protein it encodes by an organelle known as a 
ribosome, which strings together amino acids in the order specified by the sequence of 
elements in t he mRNA molecule. Since the amount of mRNA in a cell determines the amount of 
the corresponding protein, factors affecting the abundance of mRNAs play a major part in the 
normal functioning of a cell by appropriately regulating protein synthesis. For exam ple, an 
excess of certain proteins can cause cells to proliferate abnormally and become cancerous; a 
lack of the protein insulin results in diabetes.  
Biologists once assumed that the variable rates at which cells synthesize different mRNAs 
determine the q uantities of mRNAs and their corresponding proteins in a cell. However, recent 
investigations have shown that the concentrations of most mRNAs correlate best, not with their 
synthesis rate, but rather with the equally variable rates at which cells degrad e the different 
mRNAs in their cytoplasm. If a cell degrades both a rapidly and a slowly synthesized mRNA 
slowly, both mRNAs will accumulate to high levels.  
An important example of this phenomenon is the development of red blood cells from their 
unspecia lized parent cells in bone marrow . For red blood cells to accumulate sufficient 
concentrations of hemoglobin  (which transports oxygen) to carry out their main function, the 
cells parent cells must simultaneously pr oduce more of the constituent proteins of hemoglobin 
and less of most other proteins. To do this, the parent cells halt synthesis of non -hemoglobin 
mRNAs in the nucleus and rapidly degrade copies of the non -hemoglobin mRNAs remaining in 
the cytoplasm. Ha lting synthesis of mRNA alone would not affect the quantities of proteins 
synthesized by the mRNAs still existing in the cytoplasm. Biologists now believe that most cells

"Japanese firms have achieved the highest levels of manufacturing efficiency in the world 
automobile industry. Some observers of Jap an have assumed that Japanese firms use the same 
manufacturing equipment and techniques as United States firms but have benefited from the 
unique characteristics of Japanese employees and the Japanese culture. However, if this were 
true, then one would exp ect Japanese auto plants in the United States to perform no better 
than factories run by United States companies. This is not the case; Japanese -run automobile 
plants located in the United States and staffed by local workers have demonstrated higher 
levels  of productivity when compared with factories owned by United States companies.  
Other observers link high Japanese productivity to higher levels of capital investment per 
worker. But a historical perspective leads to a different conclusion. When the two to p Japanese 
automobile makers matched and then doubled United States productivity  levels in the 
mid-sixties, capital investment per employee was comparable to that of United States firms. 
Furthermore, by the late seventies, the amount of fixed assets requir ed to produce one vehicle 
was roughly equivalent in Japan and in the United States.  
Since capital investment was not higher in Japan, it had to be other factors that led to 
higher productivity. A more fruitful explanation may lie with Japanese production t echniques.  GMAT  105 
 Japanese automobile producers did not simply implement conventional processes more

"It was once believed that the brain was independent of metabolic processes occurring 
elsewhere in the body. In recent studies, however, we have discovered that the production and 
release in brain neurons of the neurotransmitter serotonin  (neurotransmitters are compounds 
that neurons use to transmit signals to other c ells) depend directly on the food that the body 
processes.  
Our first studies sought to determine whether the increase in serotonin observed in rats 
given a large injection of the amino acid tryptophan might also occur after rats ate meals that 
change trypt ophan levels in the blood. We found that, immediately after the rats began to eat, 
parallel elevations occurred in blood tryptophan, brain tryptophan, and brain serotonin levels. 
These findings suggested that the production and release of serotonin in brai n neurons were 
normally coupled with blood -tryptophan increases. In later studies we found that injecting 
insulin into a rats bloodstream also caused parallel elevations in blood and brain tryptophan 
levels and in serotonin levels. We then decided to see whether the secretion of the animals own 
insulin similarly affected serotonin production. We gave the rats a carbohydrate -containing 
meal that we knew would elicit insulin secretion. As we had hypothesized, the blood tryptophan 
level and the concentration s of tryptophan serotonin in the brain increased after the meal.  
Surprisingly, however, when we added a large amount of protein to the meal, brain 
tryptophan and serotonin levels fell. Since protein contains tryptophan, why should it depress 
brain tryptoph an levels? The answer lies in the mechanism that provides blood tryptophan to 
the brain cells. This same mechanism also provides the brain cells with other amino acids found 
in protein, such as tyrosine and Leucine. The consumption of protein increases blo od 
concentration of the other amino acids much more, proportionately, than it does that of 
tryptophan. The more protein in the meal, the lower is the ratio of the resulting

"How many really suffer as a result of labor market problems? This is one o f the most critical

in the 1930s when most of the unemployed were primary  breadwinners, when income and 
earnings were usually much closer to the margin of subsistence, and when there were no 
countervailing social programs for those failing in the labor market. Increasing affluence, the 
rise of families with more than one wage e arner, the growing predominance of secondary 
earners among the unemployed, and improved social welfare protection have unquestionably 
mitigated the consequences of joblessness. Earnings and income data also overstate the 
dimensions of hardship. Among the m illions with hourly earnings at or below the minimum 
wage level, the overwhelming majority are from multiple -earner, relatively affluent  families. 
Most of those counted by the poverty statistics are elderly or handicapped or have family

their primary applications, measuring the consequences of labor mar ket problems.","The conclusion stated in lines 33 -39 about the number of people who suffer as a 
result of forced idleness depends primarily on the point t hat","{'Choice 0': 'in times of high unemployment, there are some people who do not remain \nunemployed for long', 'Choice 1': 'the capacity for self -support depends on receiving moderate -to-high wages', 'Choice 2': 'those in forced idleness include, besides the unemployed, both \nunderemploye d part -time workers and those not actively seeking work', 'Choice 3': 'at different times during the year, different people are unemployed', 'Choice 4': 'many of those who are affected by unemployment are dependents of \nunemployed workers'}"
"How many really suffer as a result of labor market problems? This is one o f the most critical 
yet contentious social policy questions. In many ways, our social statistics exaggerate the 
degree of hardship. Unemployment does not have the same dire consequences today as it did 
in the 1930s when most of the unemployed were primary  breadwinners, when income and 
earnings were usually much closer to the margin of subsistence, and when there were no 
countervailing social programs for those failing in the labor market. Increasing affluence, the 
rise of families with more than one wage e arner, the growing predominance of secondary 
earners among the unemployed, and improved social welfare protection have unquestionably 
mitigated the consequences of joblessness. Earnings and income data also overstate the 
dimensions of hardship. Among the m illions with hourly earnings at or below the minimum 
wage level, the overwhelming majority are from multiple -earner, relatively affluent  families. 
Most of those counted by the poverty statistics are elderly or handicapped or have family 
responsibilities wh ich keep them out of the labor force, so the poverty statistics are by no 
means an accurate indicator of labor market pathologies.  
Yet there are also many ways our social statistics underestimate the degree of 
labor-market -related hardship. The unemploymen t counts exclude the millions of fully 
employed workers whose wages are so low that their families remain in poverty. Low wages 
and repeated or prolonged unemployment frequently interact to undermine the capacity for 
self-support. Since the number experien cing joblessness at some time during the year is several 
times the number unemployed in any month, those who suffer as a result of forced idleness can 
equal or exceed average annual unemployment, even though only a minority of the jobless in 
any month real ly suffer. For every person counted in the monthly unemployment tallies, there is 
another working part -time because of the inability to find full -time work, or else outside the 
labor force but wanting a job. Finally, income transfers in our country have al ways focused on 
the elderly, disabled, and dependent, neglecting the needs of the working poor, so that the 
dramatic expansion of cash and in -kind transfers does not necessarily mean that those failing in 
the labor market are adequately protected.  
As a res ult of such contradictory evidence, it is uncertain whether those suffering seriously 
as a result of labor market problems number in the hundreds of thousands or the tens of 
millions, and, hence, whether high levels of joblessness can be tolerated or must be countered 
by job creation and economic stimulus. There is only one area of agreement in this 
debate that the existing poverty, employment, and earnings statistics are inadequate for one 
their primary applications, measuring the consequences of labor mar ket problems.","Which of the following, if true, is the best criticism of the authors argument 
concerning why poverty statistics cannot properly be used to show the effects of 
problems in the labor market?","{'Choice 0': 'A short -term increase in the number of those in poverty can indicate a \nshortage of jobs because the basic number of those unable to accept \nemployment remains approximately constant.  14 GMAT, GRE, LSAT', 'Choice 1': 'For those who are in poverty as a re sult of joblessness, there are social \nprograms available that provide a minimum standard of living.', 'Choice 2': 'Poverty statistics do not consistently agree with earnings statistics, when each \nis taken as a measure of hardship resulting from unemployment.', 'Choice 3': 'The elderly and handicapped categories include many who previously were \nemployed in the labor market.', 'Choice 4': 'Since the labor market is global in nature, poor workers in one country are \ncompeting with poor workers in another with respect to the level of wages \nand the existence of jobs.'}"

"Historians of womens labor in the United States at first largely disregarded the story of 126 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 female service workers women earning wages in occupations such as salesclerk , domestic 
servant, and office secretary. These historians focused instead on factory work, primarily 
becaus e it seemed so different from traditional, unpaid womens work in the home, and 
because the underlying economic forces of industrialism were presumed to be gender -blind and 
hence emancipatory in effect . Unfortunately, emancipation has been less profound than 
expected, for not even industrial wage labor has escaped continued sex segregation in the 
workplace.  
To explain this u nfinished revolution in the status of women, historians have recently 
begun to emphasize the way a prevailing definition of femininity often determines the kinds of 
work allocated to women, even when such allocation is inappropriate to new conditions. For 
instance, early textile -mill entrepreneurs, in justifying womens employment in wage labor, 
made much of the assumption that women were by nature  skillful at detailed tasks and patient 
in carrying out repetitive chores; the mill owners thus imported into the new industrial order 
hoary stereotypes associated with the homemaking activities they presumed to have been the 
purview of women. Because w omen accepted the more unattractive new industrial tasks more 
readily than did men, such jobs came to be regarded as female jobs. And employers, who 
assumed that womens real aspirations were for marriage and family life, declined to pay 
women wages comm ensurate with those of men. Thus many lower -skilled, lower -paid, less 
secure jobs came to be perceived as female.  
More remarkable than the origin has been the persistence of such sex segregation in 
twentieth -century industry. Once an occupation came to b e perceived as female. employers 
showed surprisingly little interest in changing that perception, even when higher profits 
beckoned. And despite the urgent need of the United States during the Second World War to

passage in which of the following ways?","{'Choice 0': 'It may furnish a valid account of ore -forming processes, and, hence, can \nsupport conceptual models that have great practical significance.', 'Choice 1': 'It sugge sts that certain geological formations, long believed to be mineralized, \nare in fact mineralized, thus confirming current conceptual models.', 'Choice 2': 'It suggests that there may not be enough similarity across Archean -age \ngold-quartz vein systems to warrant the formulation of conceptual models.', 'Choice 3': 'It corrects existing theories about the chemical halos of gold deposits, and \nthus provides a basis for correcting current conceptual models.', 'Choice 4': 'It suggests that simple prospecting methods still have a higher succes s rate in \nthe discovery of gold deposits than do more modern methods.'}"
"According to a recent theory, Archean -age gold -quartz vein systems were formed over two 
billion years ago from magnetic fluids that ori ginated from molten granite -like bodies deep 
beneath the surface of the Earth. This theory is contrary to the widely held view that the 
systems were deposited from metamorphic fluids, that is, from fluids that formed during the 
dehydration of wet sedimenta ry rocks.  
The recently developed theory has considerable practical importance. Most of the gold 
deposits discovered during the original gold rushes were exposed at the Earths surface and 
were found because they had shed trails of alluvial gold  that were easily traced by simple 
prospecting  methods. Although these same methods still lead to an occasional discovery, most 
deposits not yet discovered have gone undetected because they are buried and have no surface 
express ion. 
The challenge in exploration is therefore to unravel the subsurface geology of an area and 
pinpoint the position of buried minerals. Methods widely used today include analysis of aerial 
images that yield a broad geological overview; geophysical techni ques that provide data on the  GMAT  129 
 magnetic, electrical, and mineralogical properties of the rocks being investigated; and sensitive 
chemical tests that are able to detect the subtle chemical halos that often envelop 
mineralization. However, none of these high -technology methods are of any value if the sites to 
which they are applied have never mineralized, and to maximize the chances of discovery the 
explorer must therefore pay particular attention to selecting the ground formations most likely 
to be mineralize d. Such ground selection relies to varying degrees on conceptual models, which 
take into account theoretical studies of relevant factors.  
These models are constructed primarily from empirical observations of known mineral 
deposits and from theories of ore -forming processes. The explorer uses the models to identify 
those geological features that are critical to the formation of the mineralization being modeled, 
and then tries to select areas for exploration that exhibit as many of the critical features as 
possible.","According to the passage, methods of exploring for gold that are widely used 
today are based on which of the following facts?","{'Choice 0': 'Most of the Earths remaining gold deposits are still  molten.', 'Choice 1': 'Most of the Earths remaining gold deposits are exposed at the surface.', 'Choice 2': 'Most of the Earths remaining gold deposits are buried and have no surface \nexpression.', 'Choice 3': 'Only one type of gold deposit warrants exploration, since the other types of  \ngold deposits are found in regions difficult to reach.', 'Choice 4': 'Only one type of gold deposit warrants exploration, since the other types of \ngold deposits are unlikely to yield concentrated quantities of gold.'}"

"While there is no blueprint  for transforming a largely government -controlled economy into

the total borrowings and losses of state -owned industries were running at about £3 billio n a

losses, gained over £ 34 billion from the sales, and now receives tax revenues from the newly 
privatized companies. Along with a dramatically improved overall e conomy, the government has 
been able to repay 12.5 percent of the net national debt over a two -year period.

debt, neither the individual samurai nor the shogun himself found it easy to recover.  
It was difficult for individual samurai overlords to increase their income because the 
amount of rice that farmers could be mad e to pay in taxes was not unlimited, and since the 
income of Japans central government consisted in part of taxes collected by the shogun from 
his huge domain, the government too was constrained. Therefore, the Tokugawa shoguns

twentieth century; by then , modern sanitation was able to delay exposure to polio until

"Two modes of argumentation have been used on behalf of womens emancipation in

occurred in the United States during the 1980s to increased participation in the workforce by 
certain groups, such as first -time or reentering workers, who supposedly prefer such 
arrangements. However, statistical analyses reveal that demographic changes in the workforce 
did not correlate with variations in the total number of temporary workers. Instead, these 
analyses suggest that factors affecting employers account for the rise in temporary 
employment. One factor is product demand: temporary employment is f avored by employers 
who are adapting to fluctuating demand for products while at the same time seeking to reduce 
overall labor costs. Another factor is labors reduced bargaining strength, which allows 
employers more control over the terms of employment. G iven the analyses, which reveal that 
growth in temporary employment now far exceeds the level explainable by recent workforce 
entry rates of groups said to prefer temporary jobs, firms should be discouraged from creating 
excessive numbers of temporary posi tions. Government policymakers should consider 
mandating benefit coverage for temporary employees, promoting pay equity between 
temporary and permanent workers, assisting labor unions in organizing temporary workers, 
and encouraging firms to assign tempora ry jobs primarily to employees who explicitly indicate 
that preference.","The passage suggests which of the following about the use of temporary 
emplo yment by firms during the 1980s?","{'Choice 0': 'It enabled firms to deal with fluctuating product demand far more efficiently \nthan they before the 1980s.', 'Choice 1': 'It increased as a result of increased participation in the workforce by certain \ndemography groups.', 'Choice 2': 'It w as discouraged by government -mandated policies.', 'Choice 3': 'It was a response to preferences indicated by certain employees for more \nflexible working arrangements.', 'Choice 4': 'It increased partly as a result of workers reduced ability to control the terms \nof their employment.'}"

"Although numbers of animals in a given region may fluctuate from year to year, the 
fluctuations are often temporary and, over long periods, trivial. Scientists have advanced three 
theories of population control to account for this relative constancy.  
The first theory attributes a relatively constant population to periodic climatic catastrophes 
that decimate populations with such frequency as to prevent them from exceeding some 
particular limit. In the case of small organisms with short life cycles, climatic changes need not 
be catastrophic: normal seasonal changes in photoperiod (daily amount of sunlight), for 
example, can govern population growth. This theory the density -independent view asserts 
that climatic factors exert the same regulatory effect on population regardless of the number of 
individuals in a region.  
A second theory argues that population growth is primarily density -dependent that is, the 
rate of gr owth of a population in a region decreases as the number of animals increases. The 
mechanisms that manage regulation may vary. For example, as numbers increase, the food 
supply would probably diminish, which would increase mortality. In addition, as Lotka and 
Volterra have shown, predators can find prey more easily in high -density populations. Other 
regulators include physiological control mechanisms: for example , Christian and Davis have 
demonstrated how the crowding that results from a rise in numbers may  bring about hormonal 
changes in the pituitary and adrenal  glands that in turn may regulate population by lowering 
sexual activity and inhibiting sexual maturation. There is evidence that these effects may 
persist for three generations in the absence of th e original provocation. One challenge for 
density -dependent theorists is to develop models that would allow the precise prediction of the 
effects of crowding.  
A third theory, proposed by Wynne -Edwards and termed epideictic , argues that 
organisms have evo lved a code in the form of social or epideictic behavior displays, such as 
winter -roosting aggregations or group vocalizing; such codes provide organisms with 
information on population size in a region so that they can, if necessary, exercise reproductiv e  GMAT  143

"Until recently, scientists did not know of a close vertebrate analogue to the extreme form of

sometimes even sacrifici ng their own opportunities to survive and reproduce, for the good of 
others. However, such a vertebrate society may exist among underground colonies of the highly 
social rodent Heterocephalus  glaber,  the naked mole rat.  
A naked mole rat colony, like a beeh ive, wasps nest, or termite mound, is ruled by its 
queen, or reproducing female. Other adult female mole rats neither ovulate nor breed. The 
queen is the largest member of the colony, and she maintains her breeding status through a 
mixture of behavioral a nd, presumably, chemical control. Queens have been long -lived in 150 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 captivity, and when they die or are removed from a colony one sees violent fighting for breeding 
status among the larger remaining females, leading to a takeover by a new queen.  
Eusocial inse ct societies have rigid caste systems, each insects role being defined by its 
behavior, body shape, and physiology. In naked mole rat societies, on the other hand, 
differences in behavior are related primarily to reproductive status (reproduction being li mited 
to the queen and a few males), body size, and perhaps age. Smaller non -breeding members, 
both male and female, seem to participate primarily in gathering food, transporting nest 
material, and tunneling. Larger non breeders are active in defending the colony and perhaps in 
removing dirt from the tunnels. Jarvis work has suggested that differences in growth rates may 
influence the length of time that an individual performs a task, regardless of its age.  
Cooperative breeding has evolved many times in ver tebrates, but unlike naked mole rats, 
most cooperatively breeding vertebrates (except the wild dog, Lycaon pictus ) are dominated by 
a pair of breeders rather than by a single breeding female. The division of labor within social 
groups is less pronounced am ong other vertebrates than among naked mole rats, colony size is 
much smaller, and mating by subordinate females may not be totally suppressed, whereas in 
naked mole rat colonies subordinate females are not sexually active, and many never breed.","According to the passage, naked mole rat colonies may differ from all other

 Between the eighth and eleventh centuries A. D., the Byzantine Empire staged  an almost 
unparalleled economic and cul tural revival, a recovery that is all the more striking because it 
followed a long period of severe internal decline. By the early eighth century, the empire had 
lost roughly two -thirds of the territory it had possessed in the year 600, and its remaining a rea 
was being raided by Arabs and Bulgarians, who at times  threatened to take Constantinople and 
extinguish the empire altogether. The wealth of the state and its subjects was greatly 
diminished, and artistic and literary production had virtually ceased. By the early eleventh 
century, however, the empire had regained almost half of its lost possessions, its new frontiers 
were secure, and its influence extended far beyond its borders. The economy had recovered, 
the treasury was full, a nd art and scholarship had advanced.  
To consider the Byzantine military, cultural, and economic advances as differentiated 
aspects of a single phenomenon is reasonable. After all, these three forms of progress have 
gone together in a number of states and c ivilizations. Rome under Augustus and fifth -century 
Athens provide the most obvious examples in antiquity. Moreover, an examination of the 
apparent sequential connections among military, economic, and cultural forms of progress 
might help explain the dynam ics of historical change.

 Between the eighth and eleventh centuries A. D., the Byzantine Empire staged  an almost 
unparalleled economic and cul tural revival, a recovery that is all the more striking because it 
followed a long period of severe internal decline. By the early eighth century, the empire had 
lost roughly two -thirds of the territory it had possessed in the year 600, and its remaining a rea 
was being raided by Arabs and Bulgarians, who at times  threatened to take Constantinople and 
extinguish the empire altogether. The wealth of the state and its subjects was greatly 
diminished, and artistic and literary production had virtually ceased. By the early eleventh 
century, however, the empire had regained almost half of its lost possessions, its new frontiers 
were secure, and its influence extended far beyond its borders. The economy had recovered, 
the treasury was full, a nd art and scholarship had advanced.  
To consider the Byzantine military, cultural, and economic advances as differentiated 
aspects of a single phenomenon is reasonable. After all, these three forms of progress have 
gone together in a number of states and c ivilizations. Rome under Augustus and fifth -century 
Athens provide the most obvious examples in antiquity. Moreover, an examination of the 
apparent sequential connections among military, economic, and cultural forms of progress 
might help explain the dynam ics of historical change.  
The common explanation of these apparent connections in the case of Byzantium would 
run like this: when the empire had turned back enemy raids on its own territory and had begun 
to raid and conquer enemy territory, Byzantine resou rces naturally expanded and more money 
became available to patronize art and literature. Therefore, Byzantine military achievements led 
to economic advances, which in turn led to cultural revival.  
No doubt this hypothetical pattern did apply at times durin g the course of the recovery. Yet 
it is not clear that military advances invariably came first , economic advances second, and 
intellectual advances third. In the 860s the Byzantine Empire began to recover from Arab 
incursions so that by 872 the military b alance with the Abbasid Caliphate had been permanently 
altered in the empires favor. The beginning of the empires economic revival, however, can be 
placed between 810 and 830. Finally, the Byzantine revival of learning appears to have begun 
even earlier.  A number of notable scholars and writers appeared by 788 and, by the last decade

"Two divergent definitions have dominated sociologists discussions of the nature of

many European ethnic groups in the nineteenth -century United States?","{'Choice 0': 'They emphasized economic interests as a way of mobilizing constituents \nbehind certain issues.', 'Choice 1': 'They conceived of their own ethnicity as being primordial in natu re.', 'Choice 2': 'They created cultural traditions that fused United States symbols with those \nof their countries of origin.', 'Choice 3': 'They de -emphasized the cultural components of their communities in favor of \npolitical interests.', 'Choice 4': 'They organized formal community groups designed to promote a renaissance \nof ethnic history and culture.'}"
"Two divergent definitions have dominated sociologists discussions of the nature of 
ethnicity . The first emphasizes the primordial and unc hanging character of ethnicity. In this view, 
people have an essential need for belonging that is satisfied by membership in groups based on 
shared ancestry and culture. A different conception of ethnicity de -emphasizes the cultural 
component and defines e thnic groups as interest groups. In this view, ethnicity serves as a way 
of mobilizing a certain population behind issues relating to its economic position. While both of 
these definitions are useful, neither fully captures the dynamic and changing aspects  of 
ethnicity in the United States. Rather, ethnicity is more satisfactorily conceived of as a process 
in which preexisting communal bonds and common cultural attributes are adapted for 
instrumental purposes according to changing real -life situations.  
One example of this process is the rise of participation by Native American people in the 
broader United States political system since the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Besides 
leading Native Americans to participate more actively in politics (the numbe r of Native American 
legislative officeholders more than doubled), this movement also evoked increased interest in 
tribal history and traditional culture. Cultural and instrumental components of ethnicity are not 
mutually exclusive, but rather reinforce on e another.  
The Civil Rights movement also brought changes in the uses to which ethnicity was put by 154 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 Mexican American people. In the 1960s, Mexican Americans formed community -based political 
groups that emphasized ancestral heritage as a way of mobilizing constituents. Such emerging 
issues as immigration and voting rights gave Mexican American advocacy groups the means by 
which to promote ethnic solidarity. Like European ethnic groups in the nineteenth -century 
United States, late -twentieth -century Mexican A merican leaders combined ethnic with 
contemporary civic symbols. In 1968 Henry Cisneros, then mayor of San Antonio, Texas, cited 
Mexican leader Benito Juarez as a model for Mexican Americans in their fight for contemporary 
civil rights. And every year, Mex ican Americans celebrate Cinco de Mayo  as fervently as many 
Irish American people embrace St. Patricks Day (both are major holidays in the countries of 
origin), with both holidays having been reinvented in the context of the United States and 
linked to id eals, symbols, and heroes of the United States.",The passage suggests that in 1968 Henry Cisneros most likely believed that,"{'Choice 0': 'many Mexican American would respond positively to the example of Benito \nJuarez', 'Choice 1': 'many Mexican American were insufficiently educated in Mexican history  156 GMAT, GRE, LSAT', 'Choice 2': 'the fight for civil fights in the United States had many strong parallels in both \nMexican and Irish history', 'Choice 3': 'the quickest way of organizing community -based gr oups was to emulate the \ntactics of Benito Juarez', 'Choice 4': 'Mexican Americans should emulate the strategies of Native American \npolitical leaders'}"

"The antigen -antibody immunological reaction used to be regarded as typical of 
immunological responses. Antibodies are proteins synthesized by spe cialized cells called plasma

manifestations of antigen -antibody immunity are lysis, the rapid physical rupture of antigenic 
cells and the liberation of their contents into the surrounding medium, and phagocytosis, a 
process in which antigenic particles are engulfed by and very often digested by macrophages

provided the mold that directed the synthesis of an antibody had to be seriously q ualified. The 
attempts at qualification and the information provided by research in molecular biology led 
scientists to realize that a second immunological reaction is mediated through the lymphocytes 
that are hostile to and bring about the destruction of the antigen. This type of immunological 
response is called cell -mediated immunity.  
Recent research in cell -mediated immunity has been concerned not only with the 
development of new and better vaccines, but also with the problem of transplanting tissues and  
organs from  one organism to another, for although circulating antibodies play a part in the 
rejection of transplanted tissues, the primary role is played by cell -mediated reactions. During 
cell-mediated responses, receptor sites on specific lymphocytes an d surface antigens on the 
foreign tissue cells form a complex that binds the lymphocytes to the tissue. Such lymphocytes 
do not give rise to antibody -producing plasma cells but themselves bring about the death of the 
foreign -tissue cells, probably by secre ting a variety of substances, some of which are toxic to 
the tissue cells and some of which stimulate increased phagocytic activity by white blood cells 
of the macrophage type. Cell -mediated immunity also accounts for the destruction of 
intracellular paras ites.","According to the passage, antibody -antigen and cell -mediated immunological 
reaction s both involve which of the following processes?

II. The creation of antibodies

"The antigen -antibody immunological reaction used to be regarded as typical of 
immunological responses. Antibodies are proteins synthesized by spe cialized cells called plasma 
cells, which are formed by lymphocytes (cells from the lymph system) when an antigen, a 
substance foreign to the organism s body, comes in contact with lymphocytes. Two important 
manifestations of antigen -antibody immunity are lysis, the rapid physical rupture of antigenic 
cells and the liberation of their contents into the surrounding medium, and phagocytosis, a 
process in which antigenic particles are engulfed by and very often digested by macrophages 
and polymorphs. The proce ss of lysis is executed by a complex and unstable blood constituent 
known as complement, which will not work unless it is activated by a specific antibody; the 
process of  phagocytosis is greatly facilitated when the particles to be engulfed are coated by a  
specific antibody directed against them.  
The reluctance to abandon this hypothesis, however well it explains specific processes, 
impeded new research, and for many years  antigens and antibodies dominated the thoughts of 
immunologists so completely that th ose immunologists overlooked certain difficulties. Perhaps  
the primary difficulty with the antigen -antibody explanation is the informational problem of how 
an antigen is recognized and how a structure exactly complementary to it is then synthesized. 
When m olecular biologists discovered, moreover, that such information cannot flow from 
protein to protein, but only from nucleic acid to protein, the theory that an antigen itself 
provided the mold that directed the synthesis of an antibody had to be seriously q ualified. The 
attempts at qualification and the information provided by research in molecular biology led

"The health -care economy is replete with unusual and even unique economic relationships. 
One of the least u nderstood involves the peculiar roles of producer or provider  and purchaser 
or consumer  in the typical doctor -patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is 
the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various inducements of p rice, quality, 
and utility, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Where circumstances permit the buyer 
no choice because there is effectively  only one seller and the product is relatively essential, 
government usually asserts m onopoly and places the industry under price and other regulations. 
Neither of these conditions prevails in most of the health -care industry.  
In the health -care industry, the doctor -patient relationship is the mirror image  of the 
ordinary relationship  between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a 
physician and even then there may be no real choice it is the physician who usually makes all 
significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should retu rn next Wednesday,  whether 
X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is a rare and sophisticated 
patient who will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance  questions about price, 
especially when the ailment is regarded as serious.  
This is particularly significant in relation to  hospital care. The physician must certify the 
need for hospitalization, determine what procedu res will be performed, and announce when the 
patient may be discharged. The  patient may be consulted about some of these decisions, but in 
the main  it is the doctor s judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eyes of  the 
hospital it is the physician who is the real  consumer . As a consequence,  the medical staff 
represents the power center  in hospital policy and decision -making, not the administration.  
Although usually there are in this s ituation four identifiable participants the physician, the 
hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government) the 
physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of 
the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bona fide  bills generated by the 
physician/hospital; and for the most part  the patient plays a passive role. In routine or minor 
illnesses, or just plain worries, the patient s options are, of course, much greater with respect to  
use and price. In illnesses that are of some significance, however, such choices tend to 
evaporate , and it is for these il lnesses that the bulk of the health -care dollar is spent. We 164 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 estimate that about 75 -80 percent of health -care expenditures are determined by physicians, 
not patients. For this reason, economy measures directed at patients or the general public are 
relative ly ineffective.",The author s primary purpose is to,"{'Choice 0': 'speculate about the relationship between a patient s ability to pay and the \ntreatment received', 'Choice 1': 'criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients', 'Choice 2': 'analyze some important economic  factors in health care', 'Choice 3': 'urge hospitals to reclaim their decision -making authority', 'Choice 4': 'inform potential patients of their health -care rights'}"

"About twice every century, one of the massive stars in our galaxy blows itself apart in a 
supernova explo sion that sends massive quantities of radiation and matter into space and 
generates shock waves that sweep through the arms of the galaxy. The shock waves heat the 
interstellar gas, evaporate small clou ds, and compress larger ones to the point at which they 
collapse under their own gravity to form new stars. The general picture that has been 
developed for the supernova explosion and its aftermath goes something like this. Throughout 
its evolution, a star  is much like a leaky balloon. It keeps its equilibrium figure through a 
balance of internal pressure against the tendency to collapse under its own weight. The 
pressure is generated by nuclear reactions in the core of the star which must continually suppl y 
energy to balance the energy that leaks out  in the form of radiation. Eventually the nuclear fuel 
is exhausted, and the pressure drops in the core. With nothing to hold it up, the matter in the 166 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 center of the star collapses inward, creating higher and higher densities and temperatures, until 
the nuclei and electrons are fused into a super -dense lump of matter known as a neutron star.  
As the overlying layers rain down  on the surface of the neutron star, the temperature rises, 
until with a  blinding flash of radiation, the collaps e is reversed. A thermonuclear  shock wave 
runs through the now expanding stellar envelope, fusing lighter elements into heavier ones and 
producing a brilliant visual outburst that can be as intense as the light of 10 billion s uns. The 
shell of matter thrown off by the explosion plows through the surrounding gas, producing an 
expanding bubble of hot gas, with gas temperatures in the millions of degrees. This gas will 
emit most of its energy at X -ray wavelengths, so it is not sur prising that X -ray observatories

"The uniqueness of the Japanese character is the result of two seemingly contradictory 
forces: the strength of traditions and selective receptivity to foreign achievements and

Yukichi Fukuzawa, the most eloquent spokesman of Japan s Enlightenment,  claimed: The 
Confucian civilization of the East seems to me to lack two things possessed by Western 
civilization: science in the materia l sphere and a sense of independence in the spiritual sphere.  
Fukuzawa s great influence is found in the free and individualistic philosophy of the Education 
Code of 1872, but he was not able to prevent the government from turning back to the canons 
of Confucian thought in the Imperial Rescript  of 1890. Another interlude of relative liberalism 
followed World War I, when the democratic idealism of President Woodrow Wilson had an 
important impact on Japanese intellectuals and, especially students: but more i mportant was 
the Leninist ideology of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Again in the early 1930s, nationalism 
and militarism became dominant, largely as a result of failing economic conditions.  
Following the end of World War II, substantial changes were under taken in Japan to 
liberate the individual from authoritarian restraints. The new democratic value system was 
accepted by many teachers, students, intellectuals, and old liberals, but it was not immediately 
embraced by the society as a whole. Japanese tradi tions were dominated by group values, and 
notions of personal freedom and individual rights were unfamiliar.  
Today, democratic processes are clearly evident in the widespread participation of the 
Japanese people in social and political life: yet, there is no universally accepted and stable value 
system. Values are constantly modified by strong infusions of Western ideas, both democratic

hierarchy  and rationalism over trad ition; but in practice these values are often misinterpreted 
and distorted, particularly by the youth who translate the individualistic and humanistic goals of 
democracy into egoistic and materialistic ones.  
Most Japanese people have consciously rejected C onfucianism, but vestiges of the old 
order remain. An important feature of relationships in many institutions such as political parties, 
large corporations, and university faculties is the oyabun -kobun  or parent -child relation. A party

"Public general hospitals originated in the almshouse infirmaries established as early as

nineteenth centuries, the infirmary separated from the almshouse and became an independent 
institution supported by local tax money. At the same time, private charity hospitals began to 
develop. Both  private and public hospitals provided mainly food and shelter for the 
impoverished sick, since there was little that medicine could actually do to cure illness, and the 
middle class was treated at home by private physicians.  
Late in the nineteenth century , the private charity hospital began trying to attract 
middle -class patients. Although the depression of 1890 stimulated the growth of charitable 
institutions and an expanding urban population became dependent on assistance, there was a 
decline in private contributions to these organizations which forced them to look to local 
government for financial support. Since private institutions had also lost benefactors; they 
began to charge patients. In order to attract middle -class patients, private institutions p rovided 
services and amenities that distinguished between paying and non -paying patients and made 
the hospital a desirable place for private physicians to treat their own patients. As paying 
patients became more necessary to the survival of the private hos pital, the public hospitals 
slowly became the only place for the poor to get treatment. By the end of the nineteenth 
century, cities were reimbursing private hospitals for their care of indigent patients and the 
public hospitals remained dependent on the t ax dollars.  
The advent of private hospital health insurance, which provided middle -class patients with 
the purchasing power to pay for private hospital services, guaranteed the private hospital a

patients, leaving the public hospitals to care for the poor. Although public hospitals continued to 
provide services for patients with communicable diseases and outpatient and emergency

"Public general hospitals originated in the almshouse infirmaries established as early as 
colonial times by local governments to ca re for the poor. Later, in the late eighteenth and early 
nineteenth centuries, the infirmary separated from the almshouse and became an independent 
institution supported by local tax money. At the same time, private charity hospitals began to 
develop. Both  private and public hospitals provided mainly food and shelter for the 
impoverished sick, since there was little that medicine could actually do to cure illness, and the 
middle class was treated at home by private physicians.  
Late in the nineteenth century , the private charity hospital began trying to attract 
middle -class patients. Although the depression of 1890 stimulated the growth of charitable 
institutions and an expanding urban population became dependent on assistance, there was a 
decline in private contributions to these organizations which forced them to look to local 
government for financial support. Since private institutions had also lost benefactors; they 
began to charge patients. In order to attract middle -class patients, private institutions p rovided 
services and amenities that distinguished between paying and non -paying patients and made 
the hospital a desirable place for private physicians to treat their own patients. As paying 
patients became more necessary to the survival of the private hos pital, the public hospitals 
slowly became the only place for the poor to get treatment. By the end of the nineteenth 
century, cities were reimbursing private hospitals for their care of indigent patients and the 
public hospitals remained dependent on the t ax dollars.  
The advent of private hospital health insurance, which provided middle -class patients with 
the purchasing power to pay for private hospital services, guaranteed the private hospital a 
regular source of income. Private hospitals restricted thems elves to revenue -generating 
patients, leaving the public hospitals to care for the poor. Although public hospitals continued to 
provide services for patients with communicable diseases and outpatient and emergency 
services, the Blue Cross  plans developed around the needs of the private hospitals and the 
inpatients they served. Thus, reimbursement for ambulatory care has been minimal under most 
Blue Cross plans, and provision of outpatient care has not been a major function of the p rivate 
hospital, in part because private patients can afford to pay for the services of private physicians. 
Additionally, since World War II, there has been a tremendous influx of federal money into 
private medical schools and the hospitals associated with  them. Further, large private medical 
centers with expensive research equipment and programs have attracted the best 
administrators, physicians, and researchers. As a result of the greater resources available to the

"The National Security Act  of 1947 created a national military establishment  headed by a 
single Secretary of Defense. The le gislation had been a year -and-a-half in the 
making beginning when President Truman first recommended that the armed services be 
reorganized into a single department. During that period the President s concept of a unified 
armed service was torn apart and p ut back together several times, the final measure to emerge 
from Congress being a compromise. Most of the opposition to the bill came from the Navy and 
its numerous civilian spokesmen, including Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. In support of 
unification (and a separate air force that was part of the unific ation package) were the Army air 
forces, the Army, and, most importantly, the President of the United States.  174 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 Passage of the bill did not bring an end to the bitter interservice disputes. Rather than unify, 
the act served only to federate  the military services. It neither halted the rapid demobilization of 
the armed forces that followed World War II nor brought to the new national military 
establishment the loyalties of officers steeped in the traditions of the separate services. A t a 
time when the balance of power in Europe and Asia was rapidly shifting, the services lacked any 
precise statement of United States foreign policy from the National Security Council on which to 
base future programs. The services bickered unceasingly ove r their respective roles and 
missions, already complicated by the Soviet nuclear capability that for the first time made the 
United States subject to devastating attack. Not even the appointment of Forrestal as First 
Secretary of Defense allayed the suspic ions of naval officers and their supporters that the role 
of the U.S. Navy was threatened with permanent eclipse. Before the war of words died down, 
Forrestal himself was driven to resignation and then suicide.  
By 1948, the United States military establish ment was forced to make do with a budget 
approximately 10 percent of what it had been at its wartime peak. Meanwhile, the cost of 
weapons procurement was rising geometrically as the nation came to put more and more 
reliance on the atomic bomb and its deliv ery systems. These two factors inevitably made 
adversaries of the Navy and the Air Force as the battle between advocates of the B -36 and the

other the nation s increasing reliance on strategic nuclear deterrence, the conflict between 
these two services over roles and missions was essentially a contest over slices of an 
ever-diminishing pie.  
Yet if in the end neither service was the obvious victor, the principle of  civilian dominance 
over the military clearly was. If there had ever been any danger that the United States military 
establishment might exploit, to the detriment of civilian control, the goodwill it enjoyed as a

the act served only to federate  the military services. It neither halted the rapid demobilization of 
the armed forces that followed World War II nor brought to the new national military 
establishment the loyalties of officers steeped in the traditions of the separate services. A t a

United States subject to devastating attack. Not even the appointment of Forrestal as First 
Secretary of Defense allayed the suspic ions of naval officers and their supporters that the role

"Behavior is one of two general responses available to endothermic  (warm -blooded) species 
for the regulation of body temperature, the other being inna te (reflexive) mechanisms of heat 
production and heat loss. Human beings rely primarily on the first to provide a hospitable 
thermal microclimate  for themselves, in which the transfer of heat between the body and  the 
environment is accomplished with minimal involvement of innate mechanisms of heat 
production and loss. Thermoregulatory  behavior anticipates hyperthermia, and the organism 
adjusts its behavior to avoid becoming hyperthermic: it removes layers of clothing, it goes for a 
cool swim, etc. The organism can also respond to changes in the temperature of the body core, 
as is the case during exercise; but such responses result from the direct stimulation of 
thermoreceptor s distributed widely within the central nervous system , and the ability of these 
mechanisms to help the organism adjust to gross changes in its environment is limited.  
Until recently it was assumed that organisms respond to microwave radiation in the same 
way that they respond to temperature changes ca used by other forms of radiation. After all, the 
argument runs, microwaves are radiation and heat body tissues. This theory ignores the fact 
that the stimulus to a behavioral response is normally a temperature change that occurs at the 
surface of the organ ism. The thermoreceptors that prompt behavioral changes are located 
within the first millimeter of the skin s surface, but the energy of a microwave field  may be  GMAT  177 
 selectively deposited in deep tissues, effectively bypassing these thermoreceptors, particularly 
if the field is at near -resonant frequencies. The resulting temperature profile  may well be a kind 
of reve rse thermal gradient in which the deep tissues are warmed more than those of the 
surface. Since the heat is not conducted outward to the surface to stimulate the appropriate 
receptors, the organism does not appreciate  this stimulation in the same way tha t it 
appreciates  heating and cooling of the skin. In theory , the internal organs of a human being

Until a few years ago, microwave i rradiations at equivalent plane -wave power densities of

within the range of 10 to 100 mW/cm2 might or might not produce thermal  effects; while 
effects observed at p ower densities below 10 mW/cm2 were assumed to be nonthermal  in 
nature. Experiments have shown this to be an oversimplification, and a recent report suggests 
that fields as weak as 1 mW/cm2 can be thermogenic. When the heat generated in the tissues 
by an  imposed radio frequency  (plus the heat generated by metabolism) exceeds the heat -loss

"Behavior is one of two general responses available to endothermic  (warm -blooded) species 
for the regulation of body temperature, the other being inna te (reflexive) mechanisms of heat 
production and heat loss. Human beings rely primarily on the first to provide a hospitable 
thermal microclimate  for themselves, in which the transfer of heat between the body and  the 
environment is accomplished with minimal involvement of innate mechanisms of heat 
production and loss. Thermoregulatory  behavior anticipates hyperthermia, and the organism 
adjusts its behavior to avoid becoming hyperthermic: it removes layers of clothing, it goes for a 
cool swim, etc. The organism can also respond to changes in the temperature of the body core, 
as is the case during exercise; but such responses result from the direct stimulation of 
thermoreceptor s distributed widely within the central nervous system , and the ability of these 
mechanisms to help the organism adjust to gross changes in its environment is limited.  
Until recently it was assumed that organisms respond to microwave radiation in the same 
way that they respond to temperature changes ca used by other forms of radiation. After all, the 
argument runs, microwaves are radiation and heat body tissues. This theory ignores the fact 
that the stimulus to a behavioral response is normally a temperature change that occurs at the 
surface of the organ ism. The thermoreceptors that prompt behavioral changes are located 
within the first millimeter of the skin s surface, but the energy of a microwave field  may be  GMAT  177 
 selectively deposited in deep tissues, effectively bypassing these thermoreceptors, particularly 
if the field is at near -resonant frequencies. The resulting temperature profile  may well be a kind 
of reve rse thermal gradient in which the deep tissues are warmed more than those of the 
surface. Since the heat is not conducted outward to the surface to stimulate the appropriate 
receptors, the organism does not appreciate  this stimulation in the same way tha t it 
appreciates  heating and cooling of the skin. In theory , the internal organs of a human being 
or an animal could be quite literally cooked well-done before the animal even realizes that the 
balance of its thermomicroclimate has been disturbed.  
Until a few years ago, microwave i rradiations at equivalent plane -wave power densities of 
about 100 mW/cm2 were considered unequivocally to produce thermal  effects; irradiations 
within the range of 10 to 100 mW/cm2 might or might not produce thermal  effects; while

"Since Would War II considerable advances have been made in the area of health -care 
services. These include better access to health care (particularly for the  poor and minorities), 
improvements in physical plants, and increased numbers of physicians and other health 
personnel. All have played a part in the recent improvement in life expectancy . But there is 
mounting criticism of the large remaining gaps in access, unbridled cost inflation, the further 
fragmentation of service, excessive indulgence in wasteful high -technology gadgeteering,  and 
a breakdown in doctor -patient relationships. In recent years  proposed panaceas and new 
programs, small and large, have proliferated at a feverish pace and disappointments multiply at 
almost the same rate. This has led to an increased pessimism everythin g has been tried and 
nothing works which sometimes borders on cynicism or even nihilism.  
It is true that the automatic pass through  of rapidly spiraling costs  to government and 
insurance carriers, which was set in a publicize d environment of the richest nation in the 
world,  produced for a time  a sense of unlimited resources and allowed to develop a mood 
whereby every practitioner and institution could do his own thing  without undue concern for 
the Medical Commons.  The practice of full -cost reimbursement encouraged capital investment 
and now the industry is overcapitalized. Many cities have hundreds of excess hospital beds; 
hospitals have proliferated a superabundance of high -technology equipment; and structural 
ostentation and luxury were the order of the day . In any given day, one -fourth of all community 
beds are vacant; expensive equipment is underused or, worse, used unnecessarily. Capital 
investment brings rapidly rising operating costs . 
Yet, in part, this pessim ism derives from expecting too much of health care. It must be 
realized that care is, for most people, a painful experience, often accompanied by fear and 
unwelcome results. Although there is vast room for improvement, health care will always retain  
some u npleasantness and frustration. Moreover, the capacities of medical science are limited. 
Humpty Dumpty  cannot always be put back together again. Too many  physicians are reluctant

"During the Victorian period, women writers were measured against a social rather than a  
literary ideal. Hence, it was widely thought that novels by women should be modest, religious, 
sensitive, guileless, and chaste, like their authors. Many Victorian women writers took exception 
to this belief, however, resisting the imposition of nonliterar y restrictions on their work. 
Publishers soon discovered that the gentlest and most iddylike female novelists were 
tough -minded and relentless when their professional integrity  was at stake . Keenly aware of 
their artistic responsibilities, these women writers would not make concessions to secure 
commercial success.  
The Brontes, George Eliot, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and their lesser -known 182 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 contemporaries repudiated, in their profe ssional lives, the courtesy that Victorian ladies might 
exact from Victorian gentlemen. Desiring rigorous and impartial criticism, most women writers 
did not wish reviewers to be kind to them if kindness meant overlooking their literary 
weaknesses or flatt ering them on their accomplishments simply because of their sex. They had 
expected derisive reviews; instead, they found themselves confronted with generous criticism, 
which they considered condescending. Elizabeth Barrett Browning labeled it the comparat ive 
respect which means... absolute scorn.  
For their part, Victorian critics  were virtually obsessed with finding the place of the woman 
writer so as to judge her appropriately. Many bluntly admitted that they thought Jane Eyre  a 
masterpiece if written by  a man, shocking or disgusting if written by a woman. Moreover, 
reactionary reviewers were quick to associate an independent heroine with carefully concealed 
revolutionary doctrine; several considered Jane Eyre  a radical feminist document, as indeed it 
was. To Charlotte Bronte, who had demanded dignity and independence without any 
revolutionary intent and who considered herself politically conservative, their criticism was an 
affront. Such criticism bunched all women writers together rather than treating th em as 
individual artists.  
Charlotte Bronte s experience served as a warning to other women writers about the 
prejudices that immediately associated them with feminists and others thought to be political 
radicals. Irritated, and anxious to detach themselves  from a group stereotype, many expressed 
relatively conservative views on the emancipation of women (except on the subject of women s 
education) and stressed their own domestic accomplishments. However, in identifying 
themselves with women who had chosen t he traditional career path of marriage and 
motherhood, these writers encountered still another threat to their creativity. Victorian prudery 
rendered virtually all experience that was uniquely feminine unprintable. No nineteenth -century 
woman dared to desc ribe childbirth, much less her sexual passion. Men could not write about 
their sexual experiences either, but they could write about sport, business, crime, and war all 
activities from which women were barred. Small wonder no woman produced a novel like War

women did write.",The primary purpose of the passage is to,"{'Choice 0': 'refute the contention that no Victorian woman writer produced a novel like \nWar and Peace', 'Choice 1': 'tra ce the historical relationship between radical feminist politics and the \nVictorian novels written by women', 'Choice 2': 'show how three Victorian women writers responded to criticism of their \nnovels', 'Choice 3': 'resolve the apparent contradiction between Victorian women writ ers literary \ninnovativeness and their rather conservative social views', 'Choice 4': 'describe the discrepancy between Victorian society s expectations of women \nwriters and the expectations of the women writers themselves'}"

marginal rangelands, with the result that the nomads viewed themselves as victims of a natural 
disaster. The mistaken idea that drought is an unexpected event has often been used to excuse 
the fact that long -range planning has failed to take rainfall variability into account. People 
blame the climate for agricultural failures in semiarid regions and make it a scapegoat for faulty 
population and agricultura l policies.  
Deterioration and ultimately desertification in the Sahel and in other ecosystems can be 
combated only if an ecologically realistic carrying capacity for the rangelands is determined. 
Although there appears to be widespread agreement that such a determination would be 
significant, there has been little agreement on how to make operational the concept of carrying 
capacity, defined as the amount of grazing stock that the pasture can support without 
deterioration of either the pasture or the stock.  Should the carrying capacity  be geared to the 
best, the average, or the poorest years? Which combination of statistical measures would be 
most meaningful for the planning of long -term development of rangelands? On which variables 
should such an assessment be based, vegetation, rainfall, soil, ground and surface water, or 
managerial capabilities? Such inconclusiveness within the scientific community, while 
understandable, creates confusion for the land managers, who often decide to take no action or 
who decide that all scientific suggestions are of equal weight and, therefore, indiscriminately  GMAT  191 
 choose any one of those suggested. Given the downward spiral of land deterioration, it 
becomes essential that an ecologically acceptable carry ing capacity be established and 
enforced.  
It will also be crucial that land managers know what statistical and quasi -statistical 
measures actually mean: no single number can adequately describe the climate regime of an 
arid or semiarid region. Land manager s must supplement such terms as the mean  with more 
informative statistical measures to characterize adequately the variability of the climate. The 
understanding of this high degree of variability will serve to remove one of the major obstacles 
to resolvi ng the perennial problems of the Sahel and of other arid or semiarid regions.",The tone of the passage can best be described as,"{'Choice 0': 'flippant', 'Choice 1': 'objective', 'Choice 2': 'aggressive', 'Choice 3': 'apologetic', 'Choice 4': 'unconcerned'}"

"In Roman times, defeated enemies were generally put to death  as criminals for having 
offended the emperor of Rome. In the Middle Ages, however, the practice of ransoming, or 
returning prisoners in exchange for  money,  became common. Though some saw this custom as 196 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 a step towards a more humane society, the primary reasons behind it were economic rather 
than humanitarian.  
In those times, rulers had only a limited ability to raise taxes. The y could neither force their 
subjects to fight nor pay them to do so. The promise of material compensation in the form of 
goods and ransom was therefore the only way of inducing combatants to participate in a war. In 
the Middle Ages , the predominant incentive for the individual soldier to participate in a war was 
the expectation of spoils. Although collecting ransom clearly brought financial gain, keeping a 
prisoner and arranging for his exchange had its costs. Consequent ly, several procedures were 
devised to reduce transaction costs.  
One such device was a rule asserting that the prisoner had to assess his own value. This 
compelled the prisoner to establish a value without much distortion; indicating too low a value 
would increase the captive s chances of being killed, while indicating too high a value would 
either ruin him financially or create a prohibitively expensive ransom that would also result in 
death.  
A second means of reducing costs was the practice of releasing a  prisoner on his word of 
honor . This procedure was advantageous to both parties since the captor was relieved of the 
expense of keeping the prisoner while the captive had freedom of movement. The captor also 
benefited fi nancially by having his captive raise the ransom himself. This parole  was a viable

"In Roman times, defeated enemies were generally put to death  as criminals for having 
offended the emperor of Rome. In the Middle Ages, however, the practice of ransoming, or 
returning prisoners in exchange for  money,  became common. Though some saw this custom as 196 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 a step towards a more humane society, the primary reasons behind it were economic rather 
than humanitarian.  
In those times, rulers had only a limited ability to raise taxes. The y could neither force their 
subjects to fight nor pay them to do so. The promise of material compensation in the form of 
goods and ransom was therefore the only way of inducing combatants to participate in a war. In 
the Middle Ages , the predominant incentive for the individual soldier to participate in a war was 
the expectation of spoils. Although collecting ransom clearly brought financial gain, keeping a 
prisoner and arranging for his exchange had its costs. Consequent ly, several procedures were 
devised to reduce transaction costs.  
One such device was a rule asserting that the prisoner had to assess his own value. This 
compelled the prisoner to establish a value without much distortion; indicating too low a value 
would increase the captive s chances of being killed, while indicating too high a value would 
either ruin him financially or create a prohibitively expensive ransom that would also result in 
death.  
A second means of reducing costs was the practice of releasing a  prisoner on his word of 
honor . This procedure was advantageous to both parties since the captor was relieved of the 
expense of keeping the prisoner while the captive had freedom of movement. The captor also 
benefited fi nancially by having his captive raise the ransom himself. This parole  was a viable

"In most earthquakes the Earth s crust cracks like porcelain. Stress builds up  until a fracture 
forms at a depth of a fe w kilometers and the crust slips to relieve the stress. Some earthquakes, 
however, take place hundreds of kilometers down in the Earth s mantle, where high pressure 
makes rock so ductile that it flows instead of cracking, even under stress severe enough to  
deform it like putty. How can there be earthquakes at such depths?  
That such deep events do occur has been accepted only since 1927, when the seismologist 
Kiyoo  Wadati convincingly demonstrated their existence. Instead of comparing the arrival times 
of seismic waves at different locations, as earlier researchers had done. Wadati relied on a time 
difference between the arrival of primary (P) waves and the slower secondary (S) waves. 
Because P and S waves travel at different but fairly constant speeds, the i nterval between their 
arrivals increases in proportion to  the distance from the earthquake focus , or rupture point.  
For most earthquakes, Wadati discovered, the interval was quite short near the epicenter , 
the point on the surface where shaking is strongest. F or a few events, however, the delay was 
long even at the epicenter. Wadati saw a similar pattern when he analyzed data on the intensity  GMAT  199

of earthquakes: the more common shallow events, in which the focus lay just under the

more than 50  kilometers is too ductile to store enough stress to fracture? Wadati s work

For most earthquakes, Wadati discovered, the interval was quite short near the epicenter , 
the point on the surface where shaking is strongest. F or a few events, however, the delay was 
long even at the epicenter. Wadati saw a similar pattern when he analyzed data on the intensity  GMAT  199 
 of shaking. Most earthquakes had a small area of intense shaking, which weakened rapidly with 
increasing distance from t he epicenter, but others were characterized by a lower peak intensity, 
felt over a broader area. Both the P -S intervals and the intensity patterns suggested two kinds 
of earthquakes: the more common shallow events, in which the focus lay just under the 
epicenter, and deep events, with a focus several hundred kilometers down.  
The question remained: how can such quakes occur, given  that mantle rock at a depth of 
more than 50  kilometers is too ductile to store enough stress to fracture? Wadati s work 
suggested that deep events occur in areas (now called Wadati -Benioff zones) where one crustal 
plate is forced under anoth er and descends into the mantle. The descending rock is 
substantially cooler than the surrounding mantle and hence is less ductile and much more liable 
to fracture.","The passage supports which of the following statements about the relationship 
between the epicenter and the focus of an earthquake?","{'Choice 0': 'P wa ves originate at the focus and S waves originate at the epicenter.', 'Choice 1': 'In deep events the epicenter and the focus are reversed.', 'Choice 2': 'In shallow events the epicenter and the focus coincide.', 'Choice 3': 'In both deep and shallow events the focus lies beneath the epice nter.', 'Choice 4': 'The epicenter is in the crust, whereas the focus is in the mantle.'}"
"In most earthquakes the Earth s crust cracks like porcelain. Stress builds up  until a fracture 
forms at a depth of a fe w kilometers and the crust slips to relieve the stress. Some earthquakes, 
however, take place hundreds of kilometers down in the Earth s mantle, where high pressure 
makes rock so ductile that it flows instead of cracking, even under stress severe enough to  
deform it like putty. How can there be earthquakes at such depths?

"For over 300 years, one of the most enduring beliefs among historians of England has been 
that the characte r of English society has been shaped by the unique openness of its ruling elite 
to entry by self -made entrepreneurs (especially newly wealthy merchants) able to buy their way 
into the ranks of elite society. This upward mobility , historians have argued, allowed England to 
escape the clash between those with social/political power and those with economic power, a 
conflict that beset the rest of Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Upward 
mobility was also used t o explain England s exceptional stability since the late seventeenth 
century (no revolutions, for example), as well as such major events as the development of the 
most efficient agricultural system in Europe, the making of the first industrial revolution, and 
the onset of severe economic decline.  
But is the thesis true? Recent work on the supposed consequences of an open elite has 
already produced some doubts. Little credence, for example, is now accorded the idea that 
England s late nineteenth -century econ omic decline resulted from absentee business owners 
too distracted by the demands of elite life to manage their firms properly. But, although the 
importance of an open elite to other major events has been severely questioned, it is only with 
a new work by Lawrence and Jeanne Stone that the openness itself has been confronted. 
Eschewing the tack of tracing the careers of successful entrepreneurs to gauge the openness of 
the elite, the Stones chose the alternative approach of analyzing the elite itself, and proceeded 
via the ingenious route of investigating country -house ownershi p. 
Arguing that ownership of a country house was seen as essential for membership in the 
ruling elite, the Stones analyze the nature of country -house ownership in three counties for the 
period 1540 -1880. Their critical findings are provocative: there was s trikingly little change in 
the ownership of such houses throughout the period. Instead, even in the face of a 
demographic crisis (fewer marriages, declining fertility, rising infant mortality), the old elite was 
able to maintain itself, and its estates, in tact for centuries through recourse to various marriage 
and inheritance strategies. The popular picture of venerable elite families overcome by debt 
and selling out to merchants is simply not borne out  by the Stones  findings. Rather, the 
opportunities for entrepreneurs to buy their way into the elite, the Stones show, were 
extremely limited. If further studies of country -house ownership attest to  the 
representativeness and accu racy of their data, then the Stones  conclusion that the open elite 
thesis cannot be maintained may, indeed, prove true.","Their critical findings are provocative: there was s trikingly little change in

"Comparable worth is a concept that rejects the premise of a separate and lower wage 
hierarchy for jobs that are done primarily by women, arguing instead that earnings should 
reflect  only the worth of the work performed. This worth should be determined by an evaluation 
system  that rates jobs according to their social importance and skill requirements. Because 
comparable worth does not attack all forms of inequality, it can have only a  modest direct effect 
on the overall degree of inequality in society, but in attacking gender inequality in the job 
classification system it attacks a major component of gender inequality in the United States. 
The likelihood that other forms of inequality will become more manifest with the lessening of 
gender inequality is not a valid argument against comparable worth. Indeed, struggles for 
comparable worth may help launch campaigns against similar forms of inequity. Still, while

"Historians have long thought that America was, from the beginning, profoundly influenced

important: if  Pocock s argument is right, then Americans may not be  as deeply individualistic 
and capitalistic as many believe.  
Pocock argues that out of the writings of antiquity Machiavelli created a body of political 
thinking called classical republicanism.  This b ody of thought revived the ancient belief that a 
human being was by nature a citizen who achieved moral fulfillment by participating in a 
self-governing republic. Liberty was interpreted as a condition that is realized when people are 
virtuous and are will ing to sacrifice their individual interests for the sake of the community. To 
be completely virtuous, people had to be independent and free of the petty interests of the

"Historians have long thought that America was, from the beginning, profoundly influenced 
by the Lockean notion of liberty, with its str ong emphasis on individual rights and self -interest. 
Yet in his recent book, historian J. G. A. Pocock argues that early American culture was actually 
rooted in the writings of Machiavelli, not Locke. The implications of this substitution are 
important: if  Pocock s argument is right, then Americans may not be  as deeply individualistic 
and capitalistic as many believe.  
Pocock argues that out of the writings of antiquity Machiavelli created a body of political 
thinking called classical republicanism.  This b ody of thought revived the ancient belief that a 
human being was by nature a citizen who achieved moral fulfillment by participating in a 
self-governing republic. Liberty was interpreted as a condition that is realized when people are 
virtuous and are will ing to sacrifice their individual interests for the sake of the community. To 
be completely virtuous, people had to be independent and free of the petty interests of the 
marketplace. The greatest enemy of virtue was commerce. This classical republican trad ition is 
said by Pocock to have shaped the ideology of America during the eighteenth century.  
Many events in early American history can be reinterpreted in light of Pocock s analysis. 
Jefferson is no longer seen as a progressive reader of Locke leading Ame rica into its 
individualistic future; instead Jefferson is understood as a figure obsessed with virtue and 
corruption and fearful  of new commercial developments. Influenced by Pocock, some historians 
have even argued that a communitarian and precapitalist mentality was pervasive among the

"Astrophysicists wre stling with the study of a new kind of star, the flat, two-dimensional  
configurations known as accretion disks have recently gained new insights  into the behavior of 
these stars. Accretion disks exist in a variety of situations where matters swirl around  a compact 
star such as a white dwarf star or a neutron star. Accretion disks are also suspected of playing a 
part in  more exotic situations, in which the central object is imagined to be a supermassive 
black hole, the ultimate form of collapsed matter, ra ther than a compact star. The modeling of 
accretion disks is still in its infancy, a situation analogous to the days when ordinary stars were 
modeled by using elementary scaling laws without benefit of knowledge of the nuclear 
processes that power the star s. Similarly, the basic physics of the power by which accretion 
disks radiate, thought to or iginate in a form of turbulent friction, is known only at the crudest 
level. 
Accretion disks were first defined in the context of Cataclysmic variables. In these sy stems, 
matter from the outer layers of an ordinary star is attracted by the gravitational influence of a 
nearby orbiting white dwarf star, the matter lost from the ordinary star cannot strike the surface 
of the tiny white dwarf directly but settles into an  orbit around the star. The viscosity in the disk 
thus formed causes heating, radiation, and a slow spiraling of disk matter onto the surface of 
the white dwarf.  
The rapid advances made in x -ray astronomy in the past decade have identified a second 
type of  system in which accretion disks occur. In such a system, an accretion disk whirls about 
a neutron star rather than a white  dwarf. The inner reaches of the accretion disk extend deeply 
into the gravitational potential of the neutron star where very rapid m otion is the rule. The 
energy released by friction and the actual raining of the material from the disk onto the surface 
of the neutron star is so great that radiation is given off in a powerful flood of x -rays. And in at 
least one case, x -ray astronomers believe that the object in the center of an accretion disk is a 
black hole, suggesting that a third system may exist.  
It had been assumed that portions of accretion disks would be unstable and that, as a 
result, clumping of their matter into rings would oc cur. There is no evidence from observation, 
however, that accretion disks do, in fact, suffer from these instabilities. In recent work, 
Abramowicz has shown that added gravitational effects due to general relativity may alter the 
expected Newtonian gravita tional relationships in such a way that the disk remains stable,

Accretion disks were first defined in the context of Cataclysmic variables. In these sy stems, 
matter from the outer layers of an ordinary star is attracted by the gravitational influence of a 
nearby orbiting white dwarf star, the matter lost from the ordinary star cannot strike the surface 
of the tiny white dwarf directly but settles into an  orbit around the star. The viscosity in the disk 
thus formed causes heating, radiation, and a slow spiraling of disk matter onto the surface of 
the white dwarf.  
The rapid advances made in x -ray astronomy in the past decade have identified a second 
type of  system in which accretion disks occur. In such a system, an accretion disk whirls about 
a neutron star rather than a white  dwarf. The inner reaches of the accretion disk extend deeply 
into the gravitational potential of the neutron star where very rapid m otion is the rule. The 
energy released by friction and the actual raining of the material from the disk onto the surface 
of the neutron star is so great that radiation is given off in a powerful flood of x -rays. And in at 
least one case, x -ray astronomers believe that the object in the center of an accretion disk is a 
black hole, suggesting that a third system may exist.  
It had been assumed that portions of accretion disks would be unstable and that, as a 
result, clumping of their matter into rings would oc cur. There is no evidence from observation, 
however, that accretion disks do, in fact, suffer from these instabilities. In recent work, 
Abramowicz has shown that added gravitational effects due to general relativity may alter the 
expected Newtonian gravita tional relationships in such a way that the disk remains stable, 
indicating that it is possible that these predicted instabilities do not occur.  
Further progress toward understanding accretion disks will involve defining and proposing 
solutions to restrict ed problems just as was done in this case and was done and continues to be 
done for ordinary stars. Abramowicz  work is a valuable example of the care that must be taken 
before reac hing conclusions regarding accretion disks.   GMAT  213","It can be inferred from the passage that the significance of Abramowicz  work is

"Shaws defense of a theater of ideas brought him up against  both his great 
bugbears commercialized art on the one hand and Art for Art s Sake on the other. His teaching 
is that beauty is a by -product of other activity; that the artist writes out of moral passion (in 
forms varying from political conviction to religious z eal), not out of love of art; that the pursuit 
of art for its own sake is a form of self -indulgence as bad as any other sort of sensuality . In the

unpleasant. A favorite Shavian metaphor for the function of the arts is that of tooth -pulling. 
Even if the patient is under laughing gas, the tooth is still pulled.  
The history of aesthetics affords more examples of a didactic than of a hedonist view. But

"Shaws defense of a theater of ideas brought him up against  both his great 
bugbears commercialized art on the one hand and Art for Art s Sake on the other. His teaching 
is that beauty is a by -product of other activity; that the artist writes out of moral passion (in 
forms varying from political conviction to religious z eal), not out of love of art; that the pursuit 
of art for its own sake is a form of self -indulgence as bad as any other sort of sensuality . In the 
end, the errors of pure art and of commercialized art are identical: they both appeal primarily 224 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 to the sens es. True art, on the other hand, is not merely a matter of pleasure. It may be 
unpleasant. A favorite Shavian metaphor for the function of the arts is that of tooth -pulling. 
Even if the patient is under laughing gas, the tooth is still pulled.  
The history of aesthetics affords more examples of a didactic than of a hedonist view. But 
Shaw s didacticism takes an unusual turn in its application to the history of arts. If, as Shaw 
holds, ideas are a most important part of a work of art, and if, as he also holds , ideas go out of 
date, it follows that even the best works of art go out of date in some important respects  and 
that the generally held view that great works are in all respects eternal is not shared by Shaw. 
In the preface to Three P lays for Puritans , he maintains that renewal in the arts means renewal 
in philosophy, that the first great artist who comes along after a renewal gives to the new 
philosophy full and final form, that subsequent artists, though even more gifted, can do noth ing 
but refine upon the master without matching him. Shaw, whose essential modesty  is as 
disarming as his pose of vanity is disconcerting, assigns to himself the role, not of the master, 
but of the pioneer, the role of a Marlowe rather than of a Shakespear e. The whirligig of time 
will soon bring my audiences to my own point of view,  he writes, and then the next 
Shakespeare  that comes along will turn these petty tentative s of mine into masterpieces final 
for their epoch.  
Final for their epoch even Shakespearean masterpieces are not final beyond that. No 
one, says Shaw, will ever write a better tragedy than Lear or a better opera than Don Giovanni  
or a better music drama than Der Ring des Nibelungen;  but just as essential to a play as this 
aesthetic meri t is moral relevance which, if we take a naturalistic and historical view of morals, 
it loses, or partly loses, in time. Shaw, who has the courage of his historicism, consistently 
withstands the view that moral problems  do not change, and argues therefore that for us 
modern literature and music form a Bible surpassing in significance the Hebrew Bible. That is 
Shaw s anticipatory challenge to the neo -orthodoxy of today.",Which of the following  does the author cite as a contradiction in Shaw?,"{'Choice 0': 'Whereas he pretended to be vain, he was actually modest.', 'Choice 1': 'He questioned the significance of the Hebre w Bible, and yet he believed that \na great artist could be motivated by religious zeal.', 'Choice 2': 'Although he insisted that true art springs from moral passion, he rejected the \nnotion that morals do not change.', 'Choice 3': 'He considered himself to be the pioneer of a new  philosophy , but he hoped \nhis audiences would eventually adopt his point of view.', 'Choice 4': 'On the one hand, he held that ideas are a most important part of a work of art; \non the other hand, he believed that ideas go out of date.'}"

"One of the many theories about alcoholism is the learning and re inforcement theory, which 
explains alcoholism by considering alcohol ingestion as a reflex response  to some stimulus and 
as a way to reduce an inner drive state such as fear or anxiety. Characterizing life situations in 
terms of ap proach and avoidance, this theory holds that persons tend to be drawn to pleasant 
situations and repelled by unpleasant ones. In the latter case, alcohol ingestion is said to 
reduce the tension or feelings of unpleasantness and to replace them with the fee ling of 
euphoria generally observed in most persons after they have consumed one or more drinks.  
Some experimental evidence tends to show that alcohol reduces fear in the 
approach -avoidance situation. Conger trained one group of rats to approach a food goa l and, 
using aversion conditioning, trained another group to avoid electric shock. After an injection of 
alcohol the pull away from the shock was measurable weaker, while the pull toward the food 
was unchanged.  
The obvious troubles experienced by alcoholic  persons appear to contradict the learning 
theory in the explanation of alcoholism. The discomfort, pain, and punishment they experience 
should presumably serve as a deterrent to drinking. The fact that alcoholic persons continue to 
drink in the face of fa mily discord, loss of employment, illness, and other sequels of repeated 
bouts is explained by the proximity of the drive reduction to the consumption of alcohol; that is, 
alcohol has the immediate effect  of reducing tension while the unpleasant  consequenc es of  GMAT  227 
 drunken behavior come only later. The learning paradigm, therefore , favors the establishment 
and repetition of the resort to alcohol.  
In fact, the anxieties and feelings of guilt induced by the consequences of excessive 
alcohol ingestion may themselv es become the signal for another bout of alcohol abuse. The 
way in which the cue for another bout could be the anxiety itself is explained  by the process of 
stimulus generalization: conditions or events occurring at the time of reinforcement tend to 
acquir e the characteristics of state of anxiety or fear, the emotional state itself takes on the 
properties of a stimulus, thus triggering another drinking bout.  
The role of punishment is becoming increasingly important  in formulating a cause of 
alcoholism based  on the principles of learning theory. While punishment may serve to suppress 
a response, experiments have shown that in some cases it can serve as a reward and reinforce 
the behavior . Thus if the alcoholic person has learned to drink under conditions of b oth reward 
and punishment, either type of condition  may precipitate renewed drinking.  
Ample experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that excessive alcohol consumption 
can be learned. By gradually increasing the concentration of alcohol in drinking wa ter, 
psychologists have been able to induce the ingestion of larger amounts of alcohol by an animal 
than would be normally consumed. Other researchers have been able to achieve similar results 
by varying the schedule of reinforcement that is, by requiring the animal to consume larger 
and larger amounts of the alcohol solutions before rewarding it. In this manner, animals learn to 
drink enough to become dependent on alcohol in terms of demonstrating withdrawal 
symptoms.",The primary purpose of the passage is to,"{'Choice 0': 'compare the learning and reinforcement theory to other theories of \nalcoholism', 'Choice 1': 'discuss how the behavior of alcoholic persons is explained by learning theory', 'Choice 2': 'argue that alcoholism is a learned behavior', 'Choice 3': 'explain  how fear and anxiety stimu late and reinforce drinking in alcoholic \npersons', 'Choice 4': 'present experimental evidence in support of the learning and reinforcement \ntheory of alcoholism'}"

"(The following passage was written  in 1977.)  
Changes in the volume of unemployment  are governed by three fundamental forces: the 
growth of the labor force, t he increase  in output per man -hour, and the growth of total demand 
for goods and services. Changes in the average hours of work enter in exactly parallel fashion 
but have been quantitatively less significant. As productivity  rises, less labor is required p er 
dollar  of national product, or more goods and services can be produced with the same number 
of man -hours. If output does not grow, employment will certainly fall; if production increases 
more rapidly than productivity (less any decline in average hours worked), employment must 
rise. But the labor force grows, too. Unless gross national product (total final expenditure for 
goods and services corrected for price changes) rises more rapidly than the sum of productivity 
increase and labor force growth (again  modified for any change in hours of work), the increase 230 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 in employment will be inadequate to absorb the growth in the labor force. Inevitably the 
unemployment rate will increase. Only when total production expands faster than the rate of 
labor force growth  plus the rate of productivity increase and minus the rate at which average 
annual hours fall does the unemployment rate fall. Increases in productivity were more 
important than growth of the labor force as sources of the wide gains in output experienced i n 
the period from the end of World War II to the mid -sixties. These increases in potential 
production simply were not matched by increases in demand adequate to maintain steady full 
employment.  
Except for the recession years of 1949, 1954, and 1958, the ra te of economic growth 
exceeded  the rate of productivity increase. However, in the late 1950s productivity and the 
labor force were increasing more rapidly than usual, while the growth  of output was slower 
than usual. This accounted for the change in employ ment rates.  
But if part of the national purpose is to reduce and contain unemployment, arithmetic is 
not enough. We must know which of the basic factors we can control and which we wish to 
control. Unemployment  would have risen more slowly or fallen more r apidly if productivity had 
increased more slowly, or the labor force had increased more slowly, or the hours of work had 
fallen more steeply, or total output had grown more rapidly. These are not independent factors, 
however, and a change in any of them mi ght have caused changes in the  others.  
A society can choose to reduce the growth of productivity, and it can probably find ways to 
frustrate its own creativity. However, while a reduction in the growth of productivity at the 
expense of potential output mig ht result in higher employment in the short run, the long -run 
effect on the national interest would be disastrous.  
We must also give consideration to the fact that hidden beneath national  averages is 
continuous movement into, out of, between, and within la bor markets. For example, 15 years 
ago, the average number of persons in the labor force was 73.4 million, with about 66.7 million 
employed and 3.9 million unemployed. Yet 14 million experienced some term of unemployment 
in that year. Some were new entrant s to the labor force; others were laid off temporarily . The 
remainder were those who were permanently or indefinitely severed from their jobs. Thus, the 
average number unemployed during a year understates the actual volume  of involuntary  
displacement that occurs.  
High unemployment is not an inevitable result of the pace of technological change but the 
consequence of passive public policy. We can anticipate a moderate increase in the labor force 
accompanied  by a slow and irregular decline in hours of work. It follows that the output of the 
economy and the aggregate demand to buy it must grow by more than 4 percent a year just 
to prevent the unemployment rate from rising, and by even more if the unemployment rate is to 
fall further. Yet our economy has seldom,  if ever, grown at a rate greater than 3.5 percent for

employed and 3.9 million unemployed. Yet 14 million experienced some term of unemployment 
in that year. Some were new entrant s to the labor force; others were laid off temporarily . The

growth of the labor force, t he increase  in output per man -hour, and the growth of total demand 
for goods and services. Changes in the average hours of work enter in exactly parallel fashion 
but have been quantitatively less significant. As productivity  rises, less labor is required p er

of man -hours. If output does not grow, employment will certainly fall; if production increases 
more rapidly than productivity (less any decline in average hours worked), employment must 
rise. But the labor force grows, too. Unless gross national product (total final expenditure for 
goods and services corrected for price changes) rises more rapidly than the sum of productivity 
increase and labor force growth (again  modified for any change in hours of work), the increase 230 GMAT, GRE, LSAT

unemployment rate will increase. Only when total production expands faster than the rate of 
labor force growth  plus the rate of productivity increase and minus the rate at which average 
annual hours fall does the unemployment rate fall. Increases in productivity were more 
important than growth of the labor force as sources of the wide gains in output experienced i n

But if part of the national purpose is to reduce and contain unemployment, arithmetic is

"Climatic conditions are delicately adjusted to the composition of the Earths atmosphere. If 
there were a change in the atmosphere for example, in the relative proportions of 
atmospheric gases the climate would probably cha nge also. A slight increase in water vapor, 
for instance, would increase the heat -retaining capacity of the atmosphere and would lead to a 
rise in global temperatures. In contrast, a large increase in water vapor would increase the 
thickness and extent of the cloud layer, reducing the amount of solar energy reaching the 
Earths surface.  
The level of carbon dioxide, CO 2, in the atmosphere has an important effect on climatic 
change. Most of the Earths incoming energy is short -wavelength radiation, which tend s to pass 
through atmospheric CO 2 easily. The Earth, however, reradiates much of the received energy as 
long-wavelength radiation, which CO 2 absorbs and then remits toward the Earth. This 
phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, can result in an increas e in the surface 
temperature of a planet. An extreme example of the effect is shown by Venus, a planet covered 
by heavy clouds composed mostly of CO 2, whose surface temperatures have been measured at 
430. If the CO 2 content of the atmosphere is reduced, the temperature falls. According to one 
respectable theory, if the atmospheric CO 2 concentration were halved, the Earth would become 
completely covered with ice. Another equally respectable theory, howeve r, states that a halving 
of the CO 2 concentration would lead only to a reduction in global temperatures of 3 . 
If, because of an increase in forest fires or volcanic activity, the CO 2 content of the  GRE  315 
 atmosphere increased, a warmer climate would be produced.  Plant growth, which relies on 
both the warmth and the availability of CO 2 would probably increase. As a consequence, plants 
would use more and more CO 2. Eventually CO 2 levels would diminish and the climate, in turn, 
would become cooler. With reduced tempe ratures many plants would die; CO 2 would thereby 
be returned to the atmosphere and gradually the temperature would rise again. Thus, if this 
process occurred, there might be a long -term oscillation in the amount of CO 2 present in the 
atmosphere, with regul ar temperature increases and decreases of a set magnitude.  
Some climatologists argue that the burning of fossil fuels has raised the level of CO 2 in the 
atmosphere and has caused a global temperature increase of at least 1 . But a supposed 
global temperatu re rise of 1  may in reality be only several regional temperature increases, 
restricted to areas where there are many meteorological stations and caused simply by shifts in 
the pattern of atmospheric circulation. Other areas, for example the Southern Hemis phere

restricted to areas where there are many meteorological stations and caused simply by shifts in 
the pattern of atmospheric circulation. Other areas, for example the Southern Hemis phere

"Climatic conditions are delicately adjusted to the composition of the Earths atmosphere. If 
there were a change in the atmosphere for example, in the relative proportions of 
atmospheric gases the climate would probably cha nge also. A slight increase in water vapor, 
for instance, would increase the heat -retaining capacity of the atmosphere and would lead to a 
rise in global temperatures. In contrast, a large increase in water vapor would increase the 
thickness and extent of the cloud layer, reducing the amount of solar energy reaching the 
Earths surface.  
The level of carbon dioxide, CO 2, in the atmosphere has an important effect on climatic 
change. Most of the Earths incoming energy is short -wavelength radiation, which tend s to pass 
through atmospheric CO 2 easily. The Earth, however, reradiates much of the received energy as 
long-wavelength radiation, which CO 2 absorbs and then remits toward the Earth. This 
phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, can result in an increas e in the surface 
temperature of a planet. An extreme example of the effect is shown by Venus, a planet covered 
by heavy clouds composed mostly of CO 2, whose surface temperatures have been measured at 
430. If the CO 2 content of the atmosphere is reduced, the temperature falls. According to one 
respectable theory, if the atmospheric CO 2 concentration were halved, the Earth would become 
completely covered with ice. Another equally respectable theory, howeve r, states that a halving 
of the CO 2 concentration would lead only to a reduction in global temperatures of 3 .

"My objective is to analyze  certain forms of knowledge, not in terms of repression or law, 
but in terms of power. But the word power is apt to lead to misunderstandings about the nature, 
form, and unity of power. By power, I do not mean a group of institutions and mechanisms that 
ensure the subservience of the citizenry. I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation that, in 
contrast to violence, has the form of the rule. Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of 
domination exerted by one group over another, a system whose ef fects, through successive 
derivations, pervade the entire social body. The sovereignty of the state, the form of law, or the 
overall unity of a domination are only the terminal forms power takes.  
It seems to me that power must be understood as the multipli city of force relations that are 
immanent in the social sphere; as the process that, through ceaseless struggle and 
confrontation, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them; as the support that these force 
relations find in one another, or on the contrary,  the disjunctions and contradictions that isolate 
them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they take effect, whose general 
design or institutional crystallization is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation of 
the law, in th e various social hegemonies.  
Thus, the viewpoint that permits one to understand the exercise of power, even in its more 
peripheral effects, and that also makes it possible to use its mechanisms as a structural 
framework for analyzing the social order, mu st not be sought in a unique source of sovereignty 
from which secondary and descendent forms of power emanate but in the moving substrate of

of power. If pow er seems omnipresent, it is not because it has the privilege of consolidating 
everything under its invincible unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the next, 
at every point, or rather in every relation from one point to another. Power is eve rywhere, not 
because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. And if power at times 
seems to be permanent, repetitious, inert, and self -reproducing, it is simply because the overall 
effect that emerges from all these mobilities is a co ncatenation that rests on each of them and 
seeks in turn to arrest their movement. One needs to be nominalistc, no doubt: power is not an

"My objective is to analyze  certain forms of knowledge, not in terms of repression or law,

form, and unity of power. By power, I do not mean a group of institutions and mechanisms that 
ensure the subservience of the citizenry. I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation that, in 
contrast to violence, has the form of the rule. Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of 
domination exerted by one group over another, a system whose ef fects, through successive 
derivations, pervade the entire social body. The sovereignty of the state, the form of law, or the 
overall unity of a domination are only the terminal forms power takes.  
It seems to me that power must be understood as the multipli city of force relations that are 
immanent in the social sphere; as the process that, through ceaseless struggle and 
confrontation, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them; as the support that these force 
relations find in one another, or on the contrary,  the disjunctions and contradictions that isolate 
them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they take effect, whose general 
design or institutional crystallization is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation of

domination exerted by one group over another, a system whose ef fects, through successive 
derivations, pervade the entire social body. The sovereignty of the state, the form of law, or the 
overall unity of a domination are only the terminal forms power takes.  
It seems to me that power must be understood as the multipli city of force relations that are 
immanent in the social sphere; as the process that, through ceaseless struggle and 
confrontation, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them; as the support that these force 
relations find in one another, or on the contrary,  the disjunctions and contradictions that isolate 
them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they take effect, whose general 
design or institutional crystallization is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation of 
the law, in th e various social hegemonies.  
Thus, the viewpoint that permits one to understand the exercise of power, even in its more 
peripheral effects, and that also makes it possible to use its mechanisms as a structural 
framework for analyzing the social order, mu st not be sought in a unique source of sovereignty 
from which secondary and descendent forms of power emanate but in the moving substrate of 
force relations that, by virtue of their inequality, constantly engender local and unstable states 
of power. If pow er seems omnipresent, it is not because it has the privilege of consolidating 
everything under its invincible unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the next, 
at every point, or rather in every relation from one point to another. Power is eve rywhere, not 
because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. And if power at times 
seems to be permanent, repetitious, inert, and self -reproducing, it is simply because the overall 
effect that emerges from all these mobilities is a co ncatenation that rests on each of them and 
seeks in turn to arrest their movement. One needs to be nominalistc, no doubt: power is not an 
institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the 
name that one attrib utes to a complex strategic situation in a particular society.

(E) Statement of cause and effect  
20. With which of the following statement would the author be most likely to agree?  
(A) Power tends to corrupt; absolute pow er corrupts absolutely.  
(B) The highest proof of virtue is to possess boundless power without abusing it.  
(C) To love knowledge is to love power.  
(D) It is from the people and their deeds that power springs.  
(E) The health of the people as a state is th e foundation on which all their power 
depends.

"It is well known that biological changes at the molecular level have morphogenetic 
consequences, consequences affecting the formation and differentiation of tissues and organs. 
It is superfluous to point out  that gene mutations and disturbances of the bio -synthetic 
processes in the embryo may result in abnormalities in the morphology  (structure) of an 
organism. However, whereas much is known about causes and consequences at the molecular 
level, and in spite of an enormous accumulation of chemical and morphological data on

phenomena. On ce this is done, it may be appropriate to ask questions about the molecular 
background for these changes. One may, for instance, ask whether variations in cell contact 
reflect alterations in the populations of molecules at the cell surface, or one may inqu ire about 
the molecular basis for the increased cell mobility involved in cell dispersion.  
Studies of this kind have been carried out with cells released from tissues in various ways 
and then allowed to reveal their behavior after being spread out into a t hin layer. In many cases, 
such cells show the ability to reaggregate, after which different cell types may sort themselves 
out into different layers and even take part in still more intricate morphogenetic events. But in 
most cases, the behavior of cells i n the intact embryo is difficult to study because of the 
thickness and opacity of the cell masses. The sea urchin  embryo, however, has the advantage 
that it is so transparent that each cell can be easily observed throughout development. Thus, by

background for these changes. One may, for instance, ask whether variations in cell contact

the molecular basis for the increased cell mobility involved in cell dispersion.

most cases, the behavior of cells i n the intact embryo is difficult to study because of the

"Caffeine, the stimulant in coffee, has been called the most widely used psychoactive 
substance on Earth. Sn yder, Daly and Bruns have recently proposed that caffeine affect 
behavior by countering the activity in the human brain of a naturally occurring chemical called 
adenosine. Adenosine normally depresses neuron firing in many areas of the brain. It 
apparently does this by i nhibiting the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry nerve 
impulses from one neuron to the next. Like many other agents that affect neuron firing, 
adenosine must first bind to specific receptors on neuronal membranes. There are at least two 
classes of these receptors, which have been designated A 1 and A 2. Snyder et al propose that 
caffeine, which is structurally similar to adenosine, is able to bind to both types of receptors, 
which prevents adenosine from attaching  there and allows the neurons to fire more readily than 
they otherwise would.  
For many years, caffeines effects have been attributed to its inhibition of the production of 
phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the chemical called cyclic AMP. A num ber of 
neurotransmitters exert their effects by first increasing cyclic AMP concentrations in target 
neurons. Therefore, prolonged periods at the elevated concentrations, as might be brought 
about by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, could lead to a greater a mount of neuron firing and, 
consequently, to behavioral stimulation. But Snyder et al point out that the caffeine 
concentrations needed to inhibit the production of phosphodiesterase in the brain are much 
higher than those that produce stimulation. Moreove r, other compounds that block 
phosphodiesterases activity are not stimulants.  
To buttress their case that caffeine acts instead by preventing adenosine binding, Snyder et 
al compared the stimulatory effects of a series of caffeine derivatives with their a bility to 
dislodge adenosine from its receptors in the brains of mice. In general, they reported, the 
ability of the compounds to compete at the receptors correlates with their ability to stimulate 
locomotion in the mouse; i.e., the higher their capacit y to bind at the receptors, the higher their 
ability to stimulate locomotion. Theophylline, a close structural relative of caffeine and the 
major stimulant in tea, was one of the most effective compounds in both regards.  
There were some apparent exception s to the general correlation observed between 
adenosine -receptor binding and stimulation. One of these was a compound called 
3-isobuty l-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which bound very well but actually depressed mouse 
locomotion. Snyder et al suggests that this is not a major stumbling block  to their hypothesis. 
The problem is that the compound has mixed effects in the brain, a not unusual occurrence

impulses from one neuron to the next. Like many other agents that affect neuron firing, 
adenosine must first bind to specific receptors on neuronal membranes. There are at least two 
classes of these receptors, which have been designated A 1 and A 2. Snyder et al propose that 
caffeine, which is structurally similar to adenosine, is able to bind to both types of receptors, 
which prevents adenosine from attaching  there and allows the neurons to fire more readily than 
they otherwise would.  
For many years, caffeines effects have been attributed to its inhibition of the production of 
phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down the chemical called cyclic AMP. A num ber of 
neurotransmitters exert their effects by first increasing cyclic AMP concentrations in target 
neurons. Therefore, prolonged periods at the elevated concentrations, as might be brought 
about by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, could lead to a greater a mount of neuron firing and, 
consequently, to behavioral stimulation. But Snyder et al point out that the caffeine 
concentrations needed to inhibit the production of phosphodiesterase in the brain are much 
higher than those that produce stimulation. Moreove r, other compounds that block 
phosphodiesterases activity are not stimulants.  
To buttress their case that caffeine acts instead by preventing adenosine binding, Snyder et 
al compared the stimulatory effects of a series of caffeine derivatives with their a bility to 
dislodge adenosine from its receptors in the brains of mice. In general, they reported, the 
ability of the compounds to compete at the receptors correlates with their ability to stimulate 
locomotion in the mouse; i.e., the higher their capacit y to bind at the receptors, the higher their 
ability to stimulate locomotion. Theophylline, a close structural relative of caffeine and the 
major stimulant in tea, was one of the most effective compounds in both regards.  
There were some apparent exception s to the general correlation observed between 
adenosine -receptor binding and stimulation. One of these was a compound called 
3-isobuty l-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which bound very well but actually depressed mouse 
locomotion. Snyder et al suggests that this is not a major stumbling block  to their hypothesis. 
The problem is that the compound has mixed effects in the brain, a not unusual occurrence 
with psychoactive drugs. Even caffeine, which is generally known only for its stimulatory effects, 
displays this property, depressi ng mouse locomotion at very low concentrations and stimulating 
it at higher ones.","According to Snyder et al, all of the following compounds can bind to specific 
receptors in the brain EXCEPT","{'Choice 0': 'IBMX', 'Choice 1': 'caffeine', 'Choice 2': 'adenosine', 'Choice 3': 'theophylline', 'Choice 4': 'phosphodiesterase'}"

"Although m uch has been written about the theological conflicts with Darwinian theory, little 
is known of the powerful scientific objections that modified Darwin s beliefs.  
During Darwin s lifetime, the accepted theory of heredity was not Mendel s theory of 
particula te inheritance , which, though published, was unrecognized, but the theory of blending 
inheritance , which holds that forms intermediate between those of the parents result from 
mating. Jenkin pointed out that if a rare and favorable mutation occurred, it would soon be 
blended out by repeated crossings from the wild -type form. Disputing Darwin s conception of 
evolution as proceeding through the natural selection of those with slightly better 
characteristics that arose randomly, Jenkin concluded that nat ural selection  could not account 
for the tremendous diversity of life, hypothesizing that large numbers of organisms mutated  
simultaneously  in the same direction a controlled orthogenetic process  resembling a series of 
special creations.  
Since special creationism  was an ideological target of his, Darwin found himself in a 
quandary. Although he did not abandon his theory, he admitted that natural selection played  a 
much smaller part in evo lution than he had previously claimed. He also embraced the 236 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 Lamarckian concept that acquired traits in parents are transmitted to their offspring, thus 
providing a mechanism by which an entire population  could change in the same direction at 
once.

infinitely. How, they asked, could evolution proceed by slow steps in milli ons of years, and how 
could advanced  forms recently evolved show such great differences ? The Kelvinists, basing 
their conclusion on the assumption that the sun was an incandescent liquid mass rapidly 
radiating heat, calculated that the age of the earth was  between 20 and 40 million years.

"Although m uch has been written about the theological conflicts with Darwinian theory, little 
is known of the powerful scientific objections that modified Darwin s beliefs.  
During Darwin s lifetime, the accepted theory of heredity was not Mendel s theory of 
particula te inheritance , which, though published, was unrecognized, but the theory of blending 
inheritance , which holds that forms intermediate between those of the parents result from 
mating. Jenkin pointed out that if a rare and favorable mutation occurred, it would soon be 
blended out by repeated crossings from the wild -type form. Disputing Darwin s conception of 
evolution as proceeding through the natural selection of those with slightly better 
characteristics that arose randomly, Jenkin concluded that nat ural selection  could not account 
for the tremendous diversity of life, hypothesizing that large numbers of organisms mutated  
simultaneously  in the same direction a controlled orthogenetic process  resembling a series of 
special creations.  
Since special creationism  was an ideological target of his, Darwin found himself in a 
quandary. Although he did not abandon his theory, he admitted that natural selection played  a 
much smaller part in evo lution than he had previously claimed. He also embraced the 236 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 Lamarckian concept that acquired traits in parents are transmitted to their offspring, thus 
providing a mechanism by which an entire population  could change in the same direction at 
once.  
Another potent objection came from the physicists led by Lord Kelvin, who contested the 
assumption of previous geologists and biologists that life had existed for billions of years, if not 
infinitely. How, they asked, could evolution proceed by slow steps in milli ons of years, and how 
could advanced  forms recently evolved show such great differences ? The Kelvinists, basing

"In terms of its prevalence, obesity is the leading disease in the United States. There is no 
universally accepted standard for obesity, defined generally as an excess of adipose tissue , but 
a common rule of thumb classifies people who are more than 20 percent above their desirable 
weight as obese. By this measure, 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women in America are 
obese. Although studies show that few of these  people will e ver recover fully and permanently 
from the disease, the incidence of obesity in future generations can be reduced.  
Adipose tissue is a triumph of evolution. Fat yields 9 calories per gram, while protein, like 
carbohydrates, yields only 4 calories per gram.  Fat also contains much less water than protein  
does. Therefore, fat is much more efficient for storing excess energy than is protein. Primitive 
humans, with uncertain food sources, had a great need for excess fat, and their bodies adapted 
accordingly. Modern humans, with a predictable food supply and a sedentary life -style, are 
burdened by this vestige of evolution. Although they need some adipose tissue to provide 
insulation and protect internal organs from injury, modern humans need much less than their  GMAT  239 
 primitive ancestors did.  
In an attempt to shed excess adipose tissue, many Americans turn from one fad diet to 
another, and a billion -dollar diet industry has grown up to aid them in their efforts. Nevertheless, 
the five -year cure rate for obesity is very low. In fact, by comparison, cancer is more curable. 
The reasons for this are psychological as well as physiological.  
From a physical  standpoint , losing a pound or two a week for a few weeks is not difficult 
because most of the loss is in the form of  protein and water, and protein carries four times its 
weight in water. However, protein is also the only source of nitrogen in the body, and when the 
body loses too much nitrogen, it acts to correct the imbalance  by excreting less nitrogen than it  
takes in. Hence beyond a certain point additional weight loss must come from adipose tissue, 
which, because of its compactness, takes longer to shed. The body s tendency to return  to 
nitrogen balance and to protect its energy reserves can be so strong tha t dieters may stop 
losing or even gain weight while still expending more calories than they ingest. As a result, they 
frequently suffer not only from hunger, weakness, and a decreased metabolic rate, but also 
from depression and inactivity, all of which le ad them to abandon their diets. Probably because 
of numerous psychological factors as well as physiological factors such as increased lipid 
synthesis, they then tend to regain weight rapidly.  
While vigorous attempts to reduce obesity in America should be a imed at all affected, the 
most successful efforts are likely to be those directed toward children. If the advertising and

as fat as ours is.",The passage contains information that answers which of the following questions?,"{'Choice 0': 'What percent of the total population in the United States is obese?', 'Choice 1': 'What psychologi cal factors cause people to gain weight rapidly once they go \noff a diet?', 'Choice 2': 'What function does nitrogen perform in the body?', 'Choice 3': 'How is an individual s desirable eight determined?', 'Choice 4': 'If a snack bar contains 130 calories and 4 grams of fat, what percen tage of the \ncalories in the bar come from fat?'}"
"In terms of its prevalence, obesity is the leading disease in the United States. There is no 
universally accepted standard for obesity, defined generally as an excess of adipose tissue , but 
a common rule of thumb classifies people who are more than 20 percent above their desirable 
weight as obese. By this measure, 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women in America are 
obese. Although studies show that few of these  people will e ver recover fully and permanently 
from the disease, the incidence of obesity in future generations can be reduced.  
Adipose tissue is a triumph of evolution. Fat yields 9 calories per gram, while protein, like 
carbohydrates, yields only 4 calories per gram.  Fat also contains much less water than protein  
does. Therefore, fat is much more efficient for storing excess energy than is protein. Primitive 
humans, with uncertain food sources, had a great need for excess fat, and their bodies adapted 
accordingly. Modern humans, with a predictable food supply and a sedentary life -style, are 
burdened by this vestige of evolution. Although they need some adipose tissue to provide 
insulation and protect internal organs from injury, modern humans need much less than their  GMAT  239 
 primitive ancestors did.  
In an attempt to shed excess adipose tissue, many Americans turn from one fad diet to 
another, and a billion -dollar diet industry has grown up to aid them in their efforts. Nevertheless, 
the five -year cure rate for obesity is very low. In fact, by comparison, cancer is more curable. 
The reasons for this are psychological as well as physiological.  
From a physical  standpoint , losing a pound or two a week for a few weeks is not difficult 
because most of the loss is in the form of  protein and water, and protein carries four times its 
weight in water. However, protein is also the only source of nitrogen in the body, and when the 
body loses too much nitrogen, it acts to correct the imbalance  by excreting less nitrogen than it  
takes in. Hence beyond a certain point additional weight loss must come from adipose tissue, 
which, because of its compactness, takes longer to shed. The body s tendency to return  to 
nitrogen balance and to protect its energy reserves can be so strong tha t dieters may stop 
losing or even gain weight while still expending more calories than they ingest. As a result, they 
frequently suffer not only from hunger, weakness, and a decreased metabolic rate, but also 
from depression and inactivity, all of which le ad them to abandon their diets. Probably because 
of numerous psychological factors as well as physiological factors such as increased lipid 
synthesis, they then tend to regain weight rapidly.  
While vigorous attempts to reduce obesity in America should be a imed at all affected, the 
most successful efforts are likely to be those directed toward children. If the advertising and 
food industries stop trying to sell high -calorie , nutritional ly deficient food to children, and if 
parents understand that the feeding  patterns they impose on their children can determine the 
adolescent and adult eating habits those children will develop, the future generation may not be 
as fat as ours is.","The author mentions all of the following as factors that cause obese people to

"Radiation occurs from three natural sources: radioactive material in the environment, such 
as in soil, rock, or building materials; c osmic rays; and substances in the human body, such as 
radioactive potassium in bone and radioactive carbon in tissues. These natural sources account 
for an exposure of about 100 millirems a year for the average American.  
The largest single source of man -made radiation is medical X rays, yet most scientists  
agree that hazards from this source are not as great as those from weapons test fallout, since 
strontium  90 and carbon 14 become incorporated into the body, hence delivering radiation for 
an entire lifeti me. The issue is, however, by no means uncontroversial. The last two decades 
have witnessed intensified examination and dispute about the effects of low -level radiation, 
beginning with the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiat ion, 
which reported in 1958 that even the smallest amounts of radiation are likely to cause 
deleterious genetic and perhaps also somatic effects . 
A survey conducted in Britain confirmed that an abnormally  high percentage of patients 
suffering from arthritis of the spine who had been treated  with X rays contracted cancer. 
Another study  revealed a high incidence of childhood cancer in cases where the mother had 
been given prenatal pelvic X rays. These studies have pointed to the need to reexamine the 
assumption that exposure to low -linear energy transfer  presents only a minor  risk. 
Recently, examinat ion of the death certificates of former employees of a West Coast plant 
that produces plutonium for nuclear weapons revealed markedly higher rates for cancers of the 
pancreas, lung, bone marrow , and lymphatic system  than would have been expected in a 
normal population.  
While the National Academy of Sciences committee attributes  this difference to chemical or 
other environmental causes  rather than radiation , other scientists maintain that any radiation 
exposure , no matter how small, leads to an increase in cancer risk. It is believed by some that 
a dose of one rem, if sustained over many generations, would lead to an increase  of 1 percent 
in the number of serious genetic defects  at birth,  a possible increase of 1,000 disorders per 
million births.  
In the meantime, regulatory efforts have been disorganized, fragmented, inconsistent, and 
characterized by internecine strife and bureaucratic delays. A Senate report concluded that 
coordination o f regulation among involved departments and agencies was not possible because 
of jurisdictional disputes and confusion. One federal agency has been unsuccessful in its efforts 
to obtain sufficient funding and manpower for the enforcement of existing radiat ion laws, and 
the chairperson of a panel especially created to develop a coordinated federal program has

"Radiation occurs from three natural sources: radioactive material in the environment, such

radioactive potassium in bone and radioactive carbon in tissues. These natural sources account 
for an exposure of about 100 millirems a year for the average American.  
The largest single source of man -made radiation is medical X rays, yet most scientists  
agree that hazards from this source are not as great as those from weapons test fallout, since 
strontium  90 and carbon 14 become incorporated into the body, hence delivering radiation for 
an entire lifeti me. The issue is, however, by no means uncontroversial. The last two decades 
have witnessed intensified examination and dispute about the effects of low -level radiation, 
beginning with the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiat ion, 
which reported in 1958 that even the smallest amounts of radiation are likely to cause 
deleterious genetic and perhaps also somatic effects . 
A survey conducted in Britain confirmed that an abnormally  high percentage of patients 
suffering from arthritis of the spine who had been treated  with X rays contracted cancer. 
Another study  revealed a high incidence of childhood cancer in cases where the mother had 
been given prenatal pelvic X rays. These studies have pointed to the need to reexamine the 
assumption that exposure to low -linear energy transfer  presents only a minor  risk.

While the National Academy of Sciences committee attributes  this difference to chemical or 
other environmental causes  rather than radiation , other scientists maintain that any radiation 
exposure , no matter how small, leads to an increase in cancer risk. It is believed by some that

"Many readers assume that, as a neoclassical literary critic, Samuel Johnson would normally

 spontaneous in a work of literature. Yet any close reading of Johnson s critic ism shows that 
Johnson is not blind to the importance of the immediate, vivid, specific detail in literature; rather, 
he would underscore the need for the telling  rather than the merely accidental  detail.  
In other ways, too, Johnson s critical method had m uch in common with  that of the 
Romantics, with whom Johnson and, indeed, the entire neoclassical tradition are generally 
supposed to be in conflict. Johnson was well aware, for example, of the sterility of literary 
criticism that is l egalistic or pedantic, as was the case with the worst products of the 
neoclassical school. His famous argument against the slavish following of the three unities  of 
classical drama is a good example, as is his defense of the supposedly illegitimate tragicomic  
mode of Shakespeare s latest plays. Note, in particular, the basis of that defense: That this is a 
practice contrary to the rules of criticism,  Johnson wrote, will be readily allowed; but there is 
always an appeal from criticism to nature.  
The sentiment thus expressed could easily be endorsed by any of the Romantics; the 
empiricism it exemplifies is vital quality of Johnson s criticism, as is the willingness to jettison 
laws of criticism when to do so makes possible  a more direct appeal to the  emotions of the 
reader. Addison s Cato, highly praised in Johnson s day for its correctness,  is damned with 
faint praise by Johnson: Cato affords a splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners, 
and delivers just and noble sentiments, in dic tion easy, elevated, and harmonious, but its hopes 
and fears communicate no vibration to the heart.  Wordsworth could hardly demur.  
Even on the question of poetic diction, which, according to the usual interpretation of 
Wordsworth s 1800 preface to the Lyrical Ballads , was the central area of conflict between 
Romantic and Augustan, Johnson s views are surprisingly modern.  In his Life of Dryden , he 
defends the use of a special diction in poetry, it is true; but his reasons are all -important. For 
Johnson, p oetic diction should serve the ends of direct emotional impact and ease of 
comprehension, not those of false profundity or grandiosity. Words too familiar,  he wrote, or 
too remote, defeat the purpose of a poet. From those sounds which we hear on small o r on

 spontaneous in a work of literature. Yet any close reading of Johnson s critic ism shows that 
Johnson is not blind to the importance of the immediate, vivid, specific detail in literature; rather, 
he would underscore the need for the telling  rather than the merely accidental  detail.  
In other ways, too, Johnson s critical method had m uch in common with  that of the 
Romantics, with whom Johnson and, indeed, the entire neoclassical tradition are generally 
supposed to be in conflict. Johnson was well aware, for example, of the sterility of literary 
criticism that is l egalistic or pedantic, as was the case with the worst products of the 
neoclassical school. His famous argument against the slavish following of the three unities  of 
classical drama is a good example, as is his defense of the supposedly illegitimate tragicomic  
mode of Shakespeare s latest plays. Note, in particular, the basis of that defense: That this is a 
practice contrary to the rules of criticism,  Johnson wrote, will be readily allowed; but there is 
always an appeal from criticism to nature.  
The sentiment thus expressed could easily be endorsed by any of the Romantics; the 
empiricism it exemplifies is vital quality of Johnson s criticism, as is the willingness to jettison 
laws of criticism when to do so makes possible  a more direct appeal to the  emotions of the 
reader. Addison s Cato, highly praised in Johnson s day for its correctness,  is damned with 
faint praise by Johnson: Cato affords a splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners, 
and delivers just and noble sentiments, in dic tion easy, elevated, and harmonious, but its hopes 
and fears communicate no vibration to the heart.  Wordsworth could hardly demur.  
Even on the question of poetic diction, which, according to the usual interpretation of 
Wordsworth s 1800 preface to the Lyrical Ballads , was the central area of conflict between 
Romantic and Augustan, Johnson s views are surprisingly modern.  In his Life of Dryden , he 
defends the use of a special diction in poetry, it is true; but his reasons are all -important. For 
Johnson, p oetic diction should serve the ends of direct emotional impact and ease of 
comprehension, not those of false profundity or grandiosity. Words too familiar,  he wrote, or 
too remote, defeat the purpose of a poet. From those sounds which we hear on small o r on 
coarse occasions, we do not easily receive strong impressions, or delightful images; and words 
to which we are nearly strangers, whenever they occur, draw that attention on themselves 
which they should transmit to things.  If the poetic diction of the  neoclassical poets, at its worst, 
erects needless barriers between reader and meaning, that envisioned by Johnson would do 
just the opposite : it would put the reader in closer contact with the things  that are the poem s

Confederation by which the American states had previously been governed, they had proposed 
an entirely new government. Under these circumstances , the convention was understandably 
reluctant to submi t its work to the Congress for approval.  
Instead, the delegates decided to pursue what amounted to a revolutionary course. They 
declared that ratification of the new Constitution by nine states would be sufficient to establish 
the new government. In other words, the Constitution was being submitted directly to the

"Picture -taking is a technique both for annexing the objective world and for expressing the 
singular self. Photographs depict objective realities that already exist, though only the camera 
can disclose them. And they depict an individual photographers temperament, discovering 
itself through the cameras cropping of reality. That is, photography has t wo antithetical ideals: 
in the first, photography is about the world and the photographer is a mere observe who counts 
for little; but in the second, photography is the instrument of intrepid, questing subjectivity and 
the photographer is all.  
These confli cting ideals arise from a fundamental uneasiness on the part of both 
photographers and viewers of photographs toward the aggressive component in taking a 
picture. Accordingly, the ideal of a photographer as observer is attractive because it implicitly 
denies that picture -taking is an aggressive act. The issue, of course, is not so clear -cut. What 
photographers do cannot be characterized as simply predatory or as simply, and essentially, 
benevolent. As a consequence, one ideal of picture -taking or the othe r is always being 
rediscovered and championed.  
An important result of the coexistence of these two ideals is a recurrent ambivalence 
toward photographys means. Whatever the claims that photography might make to be a form 
of personal expression on a par  with painting, its originality is inextricably linked to the powers 
of a machine. The steady growth of these powers has made possible the extraordinary 
informativeness and imaginative formal beauty of many photographs, like Harold Edgertons 
high-speed  photographs of a bullet hitting its target or of the swirls and eddies of a tennis 
stroke. But as cameras become more sophisticated, more automated, some photographers are 
tempted to disarm themselves or to suggest that they are not really armed, preferri ng to submit 
themselves to the limits imposed by premodern camera technology because a cruder, less 
high-powered machine is thought to give more interesting or emotive results, to leave more 
room for creative accident. For example, it has been virtually a point of honor for many 
photographers, including Walker Evans and Cartier -Bresson, to refuse to use modern 
equipment. These photographers have come to doubt the value of the camera as an instrument 
of fast seeing. Cartier -Bresson, in fact, claims that th e modern camera may see too fast.  
This ambivalence toward photographic means determines trends in taste. The cult of the 
future (of faster and faster seeing) alternates over time  with the wish to return to a purer 
pastwhen images had a handmade quality. This nostalgia for some pristine state of the  GRE  305

tempted to disarm themselves or to suggest that they are not really armed, preferri ng to submit 
themselves to the limits imposed by premodern camera technology because a cruder, less 
high-powered machine is thought to give more interesting or emotive results, to leave more 
room for creative accident. For example, it has been virtually a point of honor for many 
photographers, including Walker Evans and Cartier -Bresson, to refuse to use modern 
equipment. These photographers have come to doubt the value of the camera as an instrument 
of fast seeing. Cartier -Bresson, in fact, claims that th e modern camera may see too fast.  
This ambivalence toward photographic means determines trends in taste. The cult of the 
future (of faster and faster seeing) alternates over time  with the wish to return to a purer 
pastwhen images had a handmade quality. This nostalgia for some pristine state of the  GRE  305 
 photographic enterprise is currently widespread and underlies the present -day enthusiasm for 
daguerreotypes and the wok of fo rgotten nineteenth -century provincial photographers. 
Photographers and viewers of photographs, it seems, need periodically to resist their own 
knowingness.

"Scattered around the globe are more than one hundred regions of volcanic activity known 
as hot spots . Unlike most volcanoes, hot spots are rarely found along the boundaries of the 
continental and o ceanic plates that comprise the Earth s crust; most hot spots lie deep in the 
interior of plates and are anchored deep in the layers of the Earth s surface. Hot spots are also 
distinguished from other volcanoes by their lavas, which contain greater amounts  of alkali 
metals than do those from volcanoes at plate margins.  
In some cases, plates moving past hot spots have left trails of extinct volcanoes  in much 
the same way that wind passing over a chimney carries off puffs of smoke. It appears that the 
Hawaiia n Islands were created in such a manner by a single source of lava, welling up from a 
hot spot, over which the Pacific Ocean plate passed on a course roughly from the east toward 
the northwest, carrying off a line of volcanoes of increasing age. Two other Pacific island 
chains the Austral Ridge and the Tuamotu Ridge parallel the configuration of the Hawaiian 
chain; they are also aligned from the east toward the northwest, with the most recent volcanic 
activity near their eastern terminuses.  
That the Pacific  plate and the other plates are moving is now beyond dispute; the relative 
motion of the plates has been reconstructed in detail. However, the relative motion of the plates 
with respect to the Earth s interior cannot be determined easily. Hot spots provide  the 
measuring instruments for resolving the question of whether two continental plates are moving 
in opposite directions or whether one is stationary and the other is drifting away from it. The  GRE  301 
 most compelling evidence that a continental plate is stationa ry is that, at some hot spots, lavas 
of several ages are superposed instead of being spread out in chronological sequence. Of 
course, reconstruction of plate motion from the tracks of hot -spot volcanoes assumes that hot 
spots are immobile, or nearly so. Se veral studies support such an assumption, including one 
that has shown that prominent hot spots throughout the world seem not to have moved during 
the past ten million years.  
Beyond acting as frames of reference, hot spots apparently influence the geophysi cal 
processes that propel the plates across the globe. When a continental plate comes to rest over 
a hot spot, material  welling up from deeper layers forms a broad dome that, as it grows, 
develops deep fissures. In some instances, the continental plate may  rupture entirely along 
some of the fissures so that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus, just as

"Four legal approaches may be followed in attempting to channel technological 
development in socially useful  direction: specific directives, market incentive modifications, 
criminal prohibitions, and changes in decision -making structures. Specific directives involve the 
government s identifying one or more factors controlling research, development, or 
implementation of a given technology. Directives affecting such factors may vary from 
administrative regulation of private activity to government ownership of a technological 296 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 operation. Market incentive modifications are deliberate alterations of the market within which 
private decisions regarding the development and implementatio n of technology are made. Such 
modifications may consist of imposing  taxes to cover the costs t o society of a given technology, 
granting subsidies to pay for social benefits of a technology, creating the right to sue to prevent 
certain technological develo pment, or easing procedural rules to enable the recovery of 
damages to compensate for harm caused by destructive technological activity. Criminal 
prohibitions may modify technological activity in areas impinging on fundamental social values, 
or they may mo dify human behavior likely to result from technological applications for 
example, the deactivation of automotive pollution control devices in order to improve vehicle 
performance. Alteration of decision -making structures includes all possible modifications  in the 
authority, constitution, or responsibility of private and public entities deciding questions of 
technological development and implementation. Such alterations include the addition  of 
public -interest members to corporate boards, the imposition by st atute of duties on 
governmental decision -makers, and the extension of warranties in response to consumer 
action.  
Effective use of these methods to control technology depends on whether or not the goal 
of regulation is the  optimal allocation of resources. W hen the object is optimal resource 
allocation, that combination of legal methods should be used that most nearly yields the 
allocation that would exist if there were no external costs resulting from allocating resources 
through market activity. There are e xternal costs when the price set by buyers and sellers of 
goods fails to include some costs, to anyone, that result from the production and use of the 
goods. Such costs are internalized when buyers pay them.  
Air pollution from motor vehicles imposes extern al costs on all those exposed to it, in the 
form of soiling, materials damage, and disease: these externalities result from failure to place a 
price on air, thus making it a free good, common to all. Such externalities lead to nonoptimal 
resource allocatio n, because the private net product and the social net product of market 
activity are not often identical. If all externalities were internalized, transactions would occur  
until bargaining could no longer improve the situation, thus giving an optimal alloca tion of 
resources at a given time.
