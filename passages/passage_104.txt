Researchers compared the number of tooth fractures in present -day carnivores with tooth 
fractures in carnivores that lived 36,000 to 10,000 years ago and that were preserved i n the 
Rancho La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. The breakage frequencies in the extinct species were 
strikingly higher than those in the present -day species.  
In considering possible explanations for this finding, the researchers dismissed 
demographic bias be cause older individuals were not overrepresented in the fossil samples. 
They rejected preservational bias because a total absence of breakage in two extinct species 
demonstrated that the fractures were not the result of abrasion within the pits. They ruled  out 
local bias because breakage data obtained from other Pleistocene sites were similar to the La 
Brea data. The explanation they consider most plausible is behavioral differences between 
extinct and present -day carnivores in particular, more contact betw een the teeth of predators 
and the bones of prey due to more thorough consumption of carcasses by the extinct species. 
Such thorough carcass consumption implies to the researchers either that prey availability was 
low, at least seasonally, or that there wa s intense competition over kills  and a high rate of 
carcass theft due to relatively high predator densities.  
231. The primary purpose of the passage is to  
(A) present several explanations for a well -known fact  
(B) suggest alternative met hod of resolving a debate   GMAT  271 
 (C) argue in favor of a controversial theory  
(D) question the methodology used in a study  
(E) discuss the implications of a research finding  
232. The passage suggests that, compared with Pleistocene carnivores in other areas, 
Pleistocene carnivores in the La Brea area  
(A) included the same species, in approximately the same proportions  
(B) had a similar frequency of tooth fractures  
(C) populated the La Brea more densely  
(D) consumed their preys more thoroughly  
(E) found it ha rder to obtain sufficiency prey  
233. According to the passage, the researchers believes that the high frequency of 
tooth breakage in carnivores found at La Brea was caused primarily by  
(A) the aging process in individual carnivores  
(B) contact between the fossils in the pits  
(C) poor preservation of the fossils after they were removed from the pits  
(D) the impact of carnivores teeth against the bones of their prey  
(E) the impact of carnivores teeth against the bones of other carnivores during 
fights over kills  
234. The researchers conclusion concerning the absence of demographic bias would 
be most seriously undermined if it were found that  
(A) the older as ind ividual carnivore is, the more likely it is to have a large 
number of tooth fractures  
(B) the average age at death of a present -day carnivores is greater than was the 
average age at death of a Pleistocene carnivore  
(C) in Pleistocene carnivore species, old er individuals consumed carcasses as 
thoroughly as did younger individuals  
(D) the methods used to determine animals ages in fossil samples tend to 
misidentify many older individuals as younger individuals  
(E) data concerning the ages of fossil samples cannot provide reliable information 
about behavioral differences between extinct carnivores and present -day 
carnivores  
235. The passage suggests that if the researchers had not found that two extinct 
carni vore species were free of tooth breakage, the researchers would have 
concluded that  
(A) the difference in breakage frequencies could have been the result of damage 
to the fossil remains in the La Brea pits  
(B) the fossils in other Pleistocene sites could h ave higher breakage frequencies 
than do the fossils in the La Brea pits  272 GMAT, GRE, LSAT    
 (C) Pleistocene carnivore species probably behaved very similarly to one another 
with respect to consumption of carcass  
(D) all Pleistocene carnivores species differed behaviorally fro m present -day 
carnivore species  
(E) predator densities during the Pleistocene era were extremely high
